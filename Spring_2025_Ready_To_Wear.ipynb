            "['Aaron Potts returned to the New York Men’s Day showcase this morning after a season away. “Men’s Day to me is like a family reunion,” he said. “We all come here to get together and do our thing, and we know what we’re doing.”Potts had two ideas in mind for spring: The color blue—its textures, shades, and a variety of iterations from patchwork and denim to fringe—and the goal of keeping his clothes exciting but not too precious. “It’s about making and finding that special element in an everyday thing,” he said.Taking a hue as versatile as blue was an effective starting point for Potts, and his ingenuity in approaching its many applications lent his collection a good dose of dimension, particularly after his blackout fall lineup. In his silhouettes, Potts continued to expand on his exploration of utility in the context of everyday city sophistication, finding more success in his oversized shirting and his riffs on quintessential workwear styles. A pair of coveralls, which he shaped loosely and with ease, was a particular hit.Entirely new chez Potts was a run of jersey styles. The designer explained that he found his sculptural silhouettes could also be constructed close to the body, not simply oversized as is his signature, and that jersey was the right material with which to do so because of its flexibility. This was promising new ground for Potts, particularly in the womenswear space. While the A.Potts label is committed to its genderless outlook—and output—the retail landscape is considerably less flexible. Potts has been a good sport with the way he’s included more women’s options for his customers in his collections, but these have not always stuck the landing. Jersey may just be the ticket that takes him from player to winner.', 'For A.L.C.’s spring 2025 collection, Andrea Lieberman sought to tap directly into the vein of West Coast cool. “We really let the California environment inspire us both in lightness and airiness and natural fabrics,” she said. The designer more than achieved the lowkey, just-shy-of-polished brief with pieces like a paperweight crinkle suit and a raffia fabricated coat, not to mention the generally earthy color palette. Laidback doesn’t mean lazy, though. One standout detail was a brown blazer that subbed in dangling freshwater pearls in place of a traditional button closure. “I love the idea of jewelry as buttons,” said Lieberman.She leaned away from occasion wear this season, opting for everyday pieces. Even the more formal—like a grass green crinkled off-the-shoulder midi dress and a knitted maxi with a fringed scarf integrated into the neckline—were fashioned in informal fabrics. With an artful balance of relaxed fabric choices, even structured shoulders and nipped waists, it all felt slouchy and nonchalant.A.L.C. prides itself on being able to dress women across occasions. But this season Lieberman was finally filling a void: denim. “As a brand, we dress our woman for so many aspects of her life,” she said. “I wanted to dress her for more.” For spring Lieberman introduced straight-legged, wide-legged, and cropped flare jeans, as well as a denim midi skirt, sailor pants, and a chore coat with a tan corduroy collar. The pants in particular have potential to appeal to a large demographic of customers, while the trendy chore coat will speak to younger women. It is difficult to dress multiple generations of women, which Liebrman often claims is A.L.C.’s mission, but an expansion into denim seems like a shrewd way to actually do it.A.L.C. shines when Lieberman embraces effortlessness. The less involved a piece, the better—a pair of wide-legged, long white lace shorts with a shorter modesty lining seemed a bit fussy. But the body-hugging scarf dress had a sexy simplicity, as did a brown leather jacket and skirt set that melded the utilitarian and the feminine while barely lifting a finger. That is the very definition of California cool.', 'On the fringes of Paris Fashion Week, A.W.A.K.E’s Natalia Alaverdian welcomed guests to a lofty Haussmannian apartment on the Left Bank for a preview of her upcoming resort and spring collections. On the racks, a print of a perfect brown egg jumped out on one t-shirt, and then its contents made a surprise appearance, crisp-fried, on the back of a white tuxedo gown. On another t-shirt was a glossy and straight-up suggestive oyster on the half-shell. Both had been enhanced with AI. The designer described her process as “film meets culture meets objects.”It wasn’t necessarily a feminist statement either, she noted, preferring to call it “ladylike with a twist.” Even so, everything started with that egg. “I was sketching this big, Fifties-inspired skirt, and I thought, I know what this needs,” she said, picking a whole-egg t-shirt off the rack. “I just wanted something that was both very familiar and also fun.”Other pieces in the spring collection put a new spin on A.W.A.K.E’s bestselling disc motifs, rendering them as negative space, for example on a black jumpsuit with a Vasarely-like grid of circles strategically underlaid with beige. A skirt with a huge oval cut-out spanning thigh to calf was intended to be worn with the leg in or, for the daring, on the outside. Looks in beige organza looked structured yet light as meringue.“It’s textured and cosmic and a little bit provocative,” Alaverdian offered, noting that she was aiming for a post-futuristic take on fashion. Elsewhere, she took on a staple of prep, the rugby shirt, and yanked its neckline to one side, just to keep things feeling unexpected, and sometimes teased it into a skirt with that side cut-out. A tailored top came with trousers that can be fastened in the traditional way, or flash a little (or a lot) more leg.A tab motif the designer calls “fluffy” jazzed up tops or shimmied on pants. In the resort lineup, a red tab dress in cotton organza looked strong. So did a few black knit dresses that can adapt nicely to various morphologies. Skirts, including one in denim, were embellished with rotor-like panels. Sandals displayed a surrealist bent, with palm fronds splayed atop a trunk-like heel. Those will probably connect with fans in LA, Miami, and other fine-weather hotspots. A back-to-front denim shirt and upcycled deadstock jeans looked strong, too.Despite the recent upheaval in online retail, A.W.A.K.E is forging ahead with some new collaborations. A new one is upcoming with John Lewis in the UK and, as of mid-October, there’s another with Le Bon Marché and 24s. In Paris and Milan, fashion has been expressing a newfound love of combining seemingly dissonant things, and Alaverdian is counting on meeting that customer exactly where she is.', 'Several houses in fashion claim a hedonistic, rock ’n’ roll soul. There are many more that once flourished but have since disbanded. What we haven’t witnessed for some years in this arena though is a true breakout: the emergence of some young indie that grasps the flame, makes it relevant to now, and fires a generation to dress for excess.\\xa0Aaron Esh has sensed the availability of that tantalizing niche. And with the patronage of Sarabande (the foundation established and endowed by Alexander McQueen) plus the input of stylist Katy England and this season a bursary from Jaguar he seems nicely positioned to pursue it.\\xa0Esh said of tonight’s show and collection: “It’s about decadence. The idea of velvet and silk and leather. But seen in the most Hackney way.” He added that he was inspired by hard-up and hard-partying East London aesthetes who haunt Vestiaire Collective for months in order to secure that perfect vintage piece to go out in. This detail neatly dealt with any watching old-timer’s vague sense of deja-vu: for as well as McQueen, Esh’s work sometimes evoked canonical players like Lang, Slimane, Ford, Cavalli, Varvatos and Yves Saint Laurent (who is to rock ’n’ roll fashion what Muddy Waters is to rock ’n’ roll).Skinny tie/scarves from Rockins and vintage stack-heeled boots accessorized a menswear section that riffed through the heritage of glam from Marc Bolan to indie sleaze. There was a visually catchy refrain in the diagonal vectors of seamed paneling incorporated into tailored silk satin and leather. Dresses were shiny liquid licks of fabric laid expertly down and around the wearer.\\xa0“To me fashion is that girl, that person at the party,” said Esh after a show whose tautness, focus and confidence was total. What his work seems ripe for, though, is the addition of some sensation-catalyzing creative shock: a kind of Andrew Weatherall on Screamadelica layering of the unexpected that transforms the heritage he’s mining to feel entirely new and now again. You wouldn’t bet against Esh finding that fresh angle and making the breakthrough.', 'Abraham Ortuño Perez’s label may have had its on-calendar Paris Fashion Week debut this season, but he’s certainly not a new kid on the block. He launched his brand—Abra, short for Abraham—in 2020, following a string of freelance gigs at other labels. The designer already counts Rosalia and Charli XCX as fans, but he’s also responsible for some of the decade’s most viral shoe moments. The JW Anderson paw-shaped shoes and the inescapable chunky chain mules? Ortuño Perez designed them. The Loewe balloon heels and Jacquemus’s stacked double heels? Yep, that was him too.\\xa0Ortuño Perez was born and raised in Alicante, Spain, a city known for its footwear industry, but he chalks up his fashion beginnings to the women in his family. “My aunt was such a fashion girl,” he said on a call. “She worked at a shoe factory, and was this very ’80s business diva with big jewelry I used to play with.” It was her who bought the designer his Barbies when he was young, the genesis of his fashion experimentation. This should come as no surprise if you’re familiar with Abra, which is cutesy, doll-like, and always irreverent but with a tinge of early aughts glamour.\\xa0But the broader Abra aesthetic, an “oversized, sporty look worn with kitten heels,” he credits to his relationship with his sister Maria. “I used to copy everything from her,” he said. “I was like a baby doll and she was a tomboy. I loved my Barbies and pink, and she was this sort of boyish soccer player.” The meeting point of that Venn diagram is the Abra vernacular: “Picture this super gay kid trying to look like his lesbian sister.” It’s a combination of feminine signifiers turned masc, and masculine signifiers interpreted as femme, all wrapped into one and finished with a bow.After high school, Ortuño Perez relocated to Barcelona, where a friend connected him with a freelance accessories designer at Maison Margiela who was in need of an assistant. It was an unpaid role he held for three years, all the while he worked retail at a store called Pinky. “We sold trashy clothes for teenage girls, like sparkly jeans and one-shouldered tops, it was great!” he laughed. It was his then-boss who pushed him to apply to the Institut Français de la Mode in Paris. “I think I did really well there,” he said. As part of a school project, he was introduced to Simon Porte Jacquemus as he was getting ready to debut a line of accessories—Ortuño Perez ended up working on Jacquemus’s first run of shoes, including the heels with the stacked cylindrical shapes. He went on to work with a string of important labels in Paris including Givenchy under Riccardo Tisci, Kenzo, Rabanne with Julien Dossena, and he eventually linked up with Jonathan Anderson. He still freelances for JW Anderson and is back working with Jacquemus as of last season.', 'This collection and show’s germination dates back to last year, when Jonny Johansson saw an installation by the artist Jonathan Lyndon Chase at Sadie Coles HQ in London. Backstage tonight Johansson recalled how he was affected and inspired by the work’s “tenderness, playfulness, and spontaneity. And it made me think that I’d been going too mad for fashion and that I wanted to do something different and maybe take more of a risk.”Due credit to that thought’s catalyst was the new installation by the artist within the Acne Studios runway space tonight. The raised curated arrangement of layered furniture and sculpture adorned with a front row of mostly Acne-wearing show watchers encapsulated this liminal spanning of fashion and contemporary art.Lyndon Chase’s explorative approach to domesticity, privacy, and what he called “interior moments” was reflected in a collection that seemed sometimes upholstered by materials drawn from interior design. The garments also seemed to reflect an ambiguity within—or at least an ambivalence toward—the codes of identity that clothes so often encapsulate. Like much of the furniture, the garments were fundamentally conventional, yet through the process of making had become altered and amplified to interrogate that convention.This was fun. The models wore crushed coiffures and librarian’s rimless spectacles—possibly inspired by Johansson’s childhood piano teacher—as they walked past in clothes you sensed they would (and should) never grow into entirely inhabiting. Tailoring in padded mock-croc and leather overcoats was oversized and amplified. Knit looks were artfully disarrayed as if put on while still entangled from the dryer. Shrunken tops in what looked like boiled-wool blankets were frayed and picked at along their edges.All this made great context for some masterfully meta mom jeans worn under fitted tops in floral-pattern waxed tablecloth coverings (at least apparently). These jeans were fitted at the waist but then flew wide and straight at the hip, down either to a multibreak hem or a wide-cuff edged in more florals (just like some cool kids used to). Evening looks included jersey dresses in angularly layered irregular seams of differently printed fabrics—the result of some fierce argument at the haberdashery—and an endearingly klutzy lampshade gown spattered with bows: formal abnormal.', 'Adam Lippes held his spring 2025 appointments in his new salon off Fifth Avenue, steps from Central Park. The space once was occupied by Donna Summer. He’ll live across the foyer in even grander room that used to belong to Adolfo, the designer to Nancy Reagan. In a busy week of shows and presentations up and down Manhattan and across the river in Brooklyn, it made for a delightful interlude. There was a Sant’Ambroeus lunch spread, and for a repeat visit when the fashion month rush is over, a well-stocked bar, a stack of books, and a fireplace. Oh, and he’ll have a sales team and seamstresses on site; though it’s officially a by-appointment operation, he says the door will always be open. He already has a store downtown, launched bravely in the early days of reopening post-pandemic. But this private experience is something new for him—and for New York City. There’s been a lot of talk about a return to retail, but not much in the way of innovation on the sales floor. “I built the brand one-on-one, and this is a luxurious way to shop,” he said.Lippes’s new spring collection looked at home in the beautiful space: serene and lovely, but not retiring. As tempting as it might be to linger in the hushed embrace of his new salon, Lippes’s clients lead busy, active lives, and he designs for them. The first piece he pulled off a rack was a jean jacket, cropped and boxy with gold buttons featuring his freshly redesigned logo, made from hand-loomed, stonewashed Japanese denim. It looked refined but not without a sense of cool. That’s a hard balance, and it’s one that Lippes just keeps getting better at. He had downtown editor types cooing over a black double-satin evening coat with a removable hood, a lean-line silk crepe shirtdress with delicate broderie anglaise, a 1930s-ish dress in butter yellow bias silk with twisted shoulder details, and an exceptional tunic-length tank of hand-cut mother of pearl teardrop beads worn with full-legged utility pants. The most luscious material of all was the mulberry silk he used for both a bouclé skirt suit in palest lilac and a knitted tank, shown in black in the lookbook belted over another midi-skirt. “It’s the finest silk in the world,” he pointed out. Chez Adam Lippes of course it is.', \"In The Devil Wears Prada, Meryl Streep’s Miranda Priestly famously rolls her eyes at the constant presence of flowers in spring collections. “Florals, for spring? Groundbreaking,” she tells her editors. With all due respect to Mrs. Priestley, in the case of Adeam, it did feel like an exciting feat.This season, the New York and Tokyo-based designer Hanako Maeda set out to honor ikebana, the Japanese art of floral arranging. (In Japan ikebana, is treated with the same seriousness as painting or sculpture, explained Maeda.) In her first look, a strapless minidress pinned with an abundant array of yellow and white silk flowers, she embraced the technique literally: “The process of making this dress was actually very similar to doing actual ikebana,” she said. “When you make ikebana arrangements, you have a tray with needles— which is called kenzan in Japanese. You put the stem of the flower onto the needle and put them in place. Then you keep on adding more flowers and branches to create this flower arrangement. So this dress was created in a similar way, where I was just organically placing flowers.” (Maeda said it took her over a day to place them and three more to sew them strategically into place.)She also explored a more conceptual interpretation. A minidress with a ball gown skirt featured an artful organza ruffle that mimicked “a cascading flower petal going down the vines,” she said. (Although the model who wore it, Maeda’s friend Yuka, offered her own interpretation: “This dress reminds me of a cappuccino foam,” she told the designer while trying it on.) A sheer button down shirt was adorned with delicate floral embroidery that appeared to bend with the body, as did a pair of flared pale blue pants. Meanwhile, Maeda made a number of looks with matelassé fabrics, stitched with an intricate sunflower pattern. Speaking of specific blooms—the designer used flowers native to Japan. A bra top featured white hydrangeas, which spring up across the country during the rainy season in June. Mimosas were accents on shoes, and blue camellias lined a skirt.Not wanting to seem too overly sweet, Maeda smartly stuck with a muted palette: blacks, creams, whites, and navy were her go-tos, along with dusty pinks and blues. “I really like the balance between something that feels a little bit more effortless and sporty with something that feels romantic and delicate,” she said.Examine her lookbook closely, and you’ll see that aforementioned bra top pop up in several of her looks. This was Maeda’s attempt at both practicality—see, it’s a style that can be worn in more than way!—yet also ephemerality: “Ikebana is so beautiful because it doesn't last forever,” she said. “I wanted to reflect this philosophy in the styling of the collection. The pieces really morph with how the wearer wants to style the piece.”\", 'Why was there a top patchworked from doilies, a runway piled with North African and Turkish rugs, and a beaded curtain at the entrance to Priya Ahluwalia’s show? Simple: it was about home-y associations. “I’ve called the collection Home Sweet Home—it’s my exploration of what home means to me,” said the designer. “I feel like home is a physical place, but it’s also a concept. Like, how you could feel at home with a person, or you could feel at home on the other side of the world somewhere you love.”Emotional ties between her and her dual family heritages in India and Nigeria were bound up in it. “I spoke to my grandma, my Nana, about her leaving her home in India and moving to England. She was saying to me that she left over 40 years ago, but there’s always this pull for her emotionally that pulls her home.”The patterns, textiles, prints and knitwear were reminiscent of suburban wallpaper, light glinting on swimming pools or the sea. One-shoulder ‘sari’ shapes and drapes of knotted fabric stood for family bonds, and the beaded curtains familiar in Nigerian households became beaded ‘wigs.’The warmth and excitement Ahluwalia generates around her brand has long been central to the community feeling that connects her creative British peers who are immigrants, children and grandchildren of immigrants. A lot of that’s to do with the film and music scene she’s plugged into. This time, she involved Afrobeats star Adekunle Gold and MassiveMusic for the soundtrack. MassiveMusic, Ahluwalia explained, “do many things, but one of the most exciting to me is their huge database of recordings of people playing traditional instruments in refugee camps. They then package them for producers to use, and if they do, the fee goes to the musician. We used some of the tracks in the show.”She also commissioned a canun (a middle eastern stringed instrument) for a performance to preface the show by musician Shaza Manla. Ahluwalia said “I feel like we’re paying homage to people who have their human right to home disrupted. They deserve to feel at home somewhere like all of us.”', 'Of the nearly 60 Akris looks that were shown in the Gothic hall of the Collège des Bernardins, its stone vaulting dating back centuries, many featured applications of sheerness without exposing the body. Cascades of “techno tulle,” tiered waves of floaty tulle and organza in single and multiple configurations, underscored a material lightness in calm contrast to the solid stone surroundings. “What does it help when we create sheerness that cannot be worn,” said Albert Kriemler about a collection that was aptly named Flou and Pragmatism (flou referring to the fluidity and draping carried out by dressmakers).From the opening ecru layers to the pastel tones of pink and peach toward the end, the lineup was sophisticated and easy on the eyes. This can be traced back to Kriemler visiting the Camera degli Sposi in Mantua, Italy, where the frescoes of Andrea Mantegna convey his ethereal way with color.While clean lines and subtle design details are emblematically Akris, the flou made a forward impression, as though the soft asymmetric cuts and transparent layers contained all nuances while introducing some edge. For all the delicate assertions of flou, there were sporty pieces in supple leather and jackets deliberately proportioned so that everything balanced out. “It was the perfect season to play with those second and third dimensions in layering,” said Kriemler.His interest in Mantegna and the early Renaissance artists was prompted by the costumes he designed for Epilogue, John Neumeier’s final ballet as chief choreographer and director of the Hamburg Ballet, which nodded to the more saturated crimsons and ochres of Piero della Francesca. By the time the clothes are complete, all these art inspirations that underpin each Akris collection are barely discernible. They inform the creation process rather than appearing explicitly. And knowing this, you can better appreciate how 15th-century robes might evolve into a flounced minidress—a graceful simplicity inherent to each.As Akris is widely known for attracting women in high-ranking roles, from actors to politicians, my eye was continuously scanning for something Kamala Harris might be inclined to wear. “With politicians, it happens; you don’t really go for it,” Kriemler said diplomatically. If not the flou, then any one of the water-repellent parkas or raffia knits in warm beige. Or if a bag is needed, the compact, top-handle Alice (named after Akris founder Alice Kriemler-Schoch) would qualify as pragmatic…and presidential.', 'Last night’s Alaïa show at the Guggenheim began with an Instagram exchange. The museum admired a sculptural, spiraling dress from Pieter Mulier’s last show, writing “perfect” in the comments with a heart-eyes emoji; a conversation started and eventually a date was set.There’s never been a runway show at the iconic Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building. It was a long, full day of fashion in New York, but with Alaïa’s renown, Mulier’s exceptional talent, and the glamour of the VIP guests—Stephanie Seymour, Liv Tyler, Greta Lee, Lewis Hamilton—there was a heightened sense of expectation in the soaring room. With this crowd, that’s typically an only-in-Paris feeling. The moment a late arriving Rihanna took her seat, the klieg lights flipped on and the models began their long walk down the famous spiral.The museum informed some of Mulier’s silhouettes, among them the fabulous brushed shearling chubbies in ivory and salmon pink that swirled around the torso, and the micro pleated dresses that were iterations of that sculptural feat from January. Here, they were constructed with the kind of engineering used in jewelry making, snapping onto the torso like a bracelet, and ingeniously staying in place.Equally, this was a showcase of Alaïa’s fascination with American fashion—he was an avid collector—and with Mulier’s study of it. “I looked quite literally to some American designers that we haven’t forgotten in Europe, but that don’t really have the status of what a Dior has or a Chanel has. And for me, they’re as important as them,” he explained.The bandeaus and “sweatpants” were riffs on Halston’s 1970s jerseys, while Pauline Trigère cued the double-face hooded swing coats and a sweeping cape worn with matching skater minis, one of Alaïa’s most recognizable silhouettes. Charles James, one of Alaïa’s favorite designers, inspired the most direct reference, the sculpted puffer jackets, as well as the least. Cecil Beaton’s 1948 photograph for Vogue of James’s evening gowns was the starting point for the voluminous track suits in palest pastel taffeta. “I thought it was quite beautiful to bring the essence of American fashion to the collection, which is a sense of ease, which is a different kind of luxury than what we know in Europe,” he said.The models wore gold chain necklaces suspended from earrings that from a distance looked like wired headphones, bringing Alaïa “down” to the street. Only in New York. “I wouldn’t do this show in Paris,” he said. It was a clever touch from a designer who, you get the feeling, thinks of everything.On Sunday he’ll host a private viewing at the Brant Foundation of never-before-exhibited photographic reproductions of the pictures Andy Warhol took at the 1982 show Alaïa staged at the Palladium nightclub, a fashion legend brought marvelously back to life. Mulier has been named in the endless talk about the open job at Chanel; he’s one of just a few contenders up to the task, but let’s hope he doesn’t rush off. His Alaïa is so good, and he’s having so much fun.', 'Alain Paul made his first official, on-calendar PFW debut Tuesday morning at the Théâtre du Chatelet. It was here that Rudolf Nureyev performed Afternoon of a Faun about 40 years ago. Paul looked to Nureyev and other greats—like the legendary dancer-choreographers Merce Cunningham, Pina Bausch, and Roland Petit—for a spring collection he described as being “from a choreographer’s point of view,” he said.Diagrammatic squiggles on T-shirts and a hot yellow sweatshirt etched that out quite literally (those were informed by Cunningham’s sketches). But it was his own 15-year career in dance that ultimately led Paul to fashion—first at Vetements with Demna a decade ago and then at Louis Vuitton men’s under Virgil Abloh. So when the designer stepped out on his own last year, he wanted to lean in on “body awareness and improvisation.”His intent with the opening look in black and white was to make a statement about movement and constraint, though its form might equally be a metaphor for the work of coming out of one’s shell—after all, Paul began designing his own costumes at the age of 10. Throughout the show, he made a case for the return of the stirrup hem, which unsurprisingly worked better on pants than on dresses. Some looks felt hobbled; a long white dress with graceful draping or the long pink skirt shown with a crisp white shirt à la Sharon Stone at the 1998 Oscars were among several that could have been left out. A handful of ethereal asymmetrical dresses—tailored to the body on one side, cascading on the other, and layered over a white base—made a statement about clothes as movement.Nureyev’s rigor was the inspiration behind tailored pieces, including a top, pencil skirt, and shift dress in transparent crin—a popular material in Paris this season—as well as a skirt layered over white shirting. A leather jacket with a slightly elevated, structured shoulder was among a sprinkling of pieces with instant commercial appeal and was paired with Paul’s first accessory, an armband pouch informed by kneepads. Inspired by ballet pointes, the Pina shoe in stiletto, flat, or mule iterations just might catch on. It’ll be interesting to see where Paul goes once he decides to take a few more steps away from dance and gives himself more range.', 'With ruffles aflutter in the midst of a major boho revival on the runways, Alberta Ferretti is in the middle of the fashion conversation once again. This isn’t a case of sniffing out a trend. Wispy chiffon dresses have been Ferretti’s signature since before the last boho revival, but she made the most of the moment this evening, putting on a show under the colonnade of the Leonardo da Vinci Museum of Science and Technology. We were outside as the sun went down, pretty dresses catching the breeze.Backstage Ferretti was quick to point out, as she often does these days, that she designs for “all of the necessities” of today. “I know the show is important—it’s a show—but also important is the reality,” she said. So, in addition to chiffon ruffles, she showed cotton separates of the office-wearing, brunchgoing, and evening-strolling type. Some came in white and others in awning stripes; what made them Ferretti-ish were their feminine touches, like a portrait neckline on a shirtdress or peekaboo shoulders on a top. She also used bright orange cotton for a strapless dress with vertical pin-tucking details, which made her the second designer of the day to use the humble, everyday material in that kind of elevated way.But the looks that really got the hometown crowd’s camera phones in the air were her chiffon numbers, and Ferretti had one for every type: angelic in white with a halter neckline or witchier in black with dramatic cape-like wings, with many colors of the rainbow in between. The petal and leaf shapes inset into some of them were achieved via laser cutting, sequins and crystals being not especially bohemian. For adornment instead, Ferretti preferred a blown-glass flower on a black silk ribbon tied at the neck.', 'When designer Alejandra Alonso Rojas was researching venues for her New York Fashion Week spring show, she toured the New-York Historical Society on the Upper West Side—and was instantly drawn to the giant Picasso painting inside it, titled Le Tricorne. “It’s inspired by Andalusia, which so happens to be the theme of my whole collection,” said Rojas. It was a sign: The designer ended up showing in the grand building today, with the Picasso serving as the backdrop of her new runway assortment, all dedicated to highlighting Spanish culture and craftsmanship.While Rojas’s signature dresses always pay homage to her native country in some way, the new spring offering zeroed in on the unique color palette of Andalusia, including lemon yellows, dusty blues, and rosé pinks. She also felt drawn to the more soft, fluid silhouettes that many women wear in the region: “the construction of their dresses, and how fluidly they move.” You could certainly see that in one of her opening dresses, a bright-yellow chiffon number with big flowers along the left shoulder. “All our our flowers were handmade in the garment district,” said Rojas. There was also a sense of ease and movement in her silky champagne-colored suit, paired with bra tops and espadrilles that were crocheted and hand-painted in Menorca.Given that the line was a love letter to Andalusia, Rojas also wanted to capture the unique handwork artisans do in the region. “It’s an area of Spain that has a lot of craftsmanship, especially with laces and embroideries,” said Rojas. “Over the summer I met these women from Galicia, and they do one of the oldest lace [styles] in the world, called Camariñas.” Their lacework—which is done by hand, using bobbins and pins—was applied as front panels onto Rojas’s silky shift dresses, an elegant fusion of the old with the modern. Broderie anglaise, a needlework technique, was also applied as trim on her fitted corset tops.The national flower of Spain, red carnations, appeared as prints on the designer’s ruffled white skirts and halter-style minidresses. The graphic print was achieved by stamping flowers with acrylic paint onto her fabrics, then printing it. In a sea of different inspirations and references during Fashion Week, Rojas’s commitment to highlighting her own roots remains a sweet constant.', 'Alessandra Rich’s presentation took place in her brand’s expansive Art Deco showroom, featuring black-and-white marble floors and opulent gilded finishes. The setting framed her elegant spring collection, designed for women with a packed social calendar filled with cocktails and soirées. Rich is known for weaving a naughty edge into her seemingly prim and proper dresses. “My collections are for women who are seriously sensual,” she remarked.The hallmark of Rich’s aesthetic lay in the tension between the bourgeois surface of her designs and the provocative spirit simmering beneath. Delicate white lace or piqué collarettes, dainty bows, and soft ruffles were deliberately juxtaposed with silhouettes with an ingenue twist. For daytime wear, Rich’s fluid silk crepe dresses, featuring pussy bows and pleated skirts, were subtly subverted by daring front slits, tempering their demure appeal with an edge of sensuality. A masculine pantsuit was introduced as a counterpoint to more dramatic evening pieces, overlaid with layers of black Chantilly lace that evoked a seductive ésprit lingerie.', 'Seán McGirr’s second runway outing for McQueen began with a tailored suit, the lapels rolled together at the chest as if to ward off a sudden London rainstorm—or perhaps the buffeting of his critics. The Irishman’s debut was met with intense skepticism last season. He was an untested frontman replacing the beloved Sarah Burton, who had been Lee Alexander McQueen’s right hand and led the house on her own for over a decade. It was never going to be an easy launch, but it was made more difficult by the inhospitable warehouse space he chose on the outskirts of Paris for his show and the cold, rainy drive required to get there.Putting all that behind him tonight, he staged his sophomore outing at the École des Beaux-Arts, right off the Seine on the Left Bank, a venue that’s hosted scores of shows over the years, though never a McQueen collection if memory serves. And, as McGirr pointed out, he had the benefit of a longer lead-up than he did for his first go-round. It showed in the collection, which was more cohesive and more commercially viable.He said that he started by looking at Lee McQueen’s sketches, which are collected in the label’s archives. “You know, his signature was really the S-bend, so I was thinking of a way to interpret it,” he said. That’s how the rolled lapel silhouette came about. He also played with McQueen’s iconic bumster, cutting mid-rise trousers with a horizontal mesh panel an inch or so below the waistband that provided a peekaboo glimpse of skin whose effect was sweeter and less daring than the scandalizing originals. On the more informal side, he used military surplus for a cropped jacket, worn with a bustle-backed mini kilt, as well as a washed cotton mac with a contrast-colored velvet collar.McGirr had also been inspired by McQueen’s second runway show, Banshee, citing commonalities in their Celtic heritage and the stories his mother told him about the banshees’ strong spirit. The sophomore season parallel is handy too. Where his first reference, The Birds, is remembered as a fairly aggressive McQueen show, Banshee had dark romantic undertones. They manifested most clearly in a long black dress embroidered with thorns, a reference recognizable from the Met Gala dress he designed for Lana Del Rey.Comparatively, there was a bigger emphasis on red-carpet fare this season. McGirr’s got a surer hand with eveningwear than with tailoring, which will prove useful, given the valuable role celebrities can often play in rebrands these days. Daphne Guinness, who bought Isabella Blow’s extensive collection of McQueen’s work after her passing, was in the crowd tonight, giving McGirr her blessing. A frayed lilac georgette party dress inset with embroideries of silver bullion was striking, and a minidress in brushed white chiffon worn with a gold beaded and sequined jacket made for a strong look. But the one that really got the blood pumping—the one you could picture Guinness in—was the most extreme, with its shining embroideries of silver chains that followed the lines of the body. McGirr made some important advances here.', 'For several seasons now, Alexis Mabille has kept his most lavish creative displays for couture week, preferring instead to show an evening capsule collection during the Paris ready-to-wear shows. With his signature silhouettes and shapes, and his seasonal twists on color and couture-style embellishments, it’s his way of reminding his younger fans that he’s got them covered. This collection is more relaxed than couture, the designer points out, plus these dresses are designed to travel easily wherever his ladies are headed.“Reworking the essentials” is how Mabille described this lineup of 17 dresses, which can be made long or short—and in other colors and materials, for that matter. This season’s theme was spring dew, in sunrise hues of blue, lilac, or the shimmering pink that one might find in a Monet painting.Among Mabille’s signatures—the shirtdress (in taffeta), the bow dress (in silk piqué), a voluminous number inspired by a 19th-century painter’s blouse (also in silk piqué, with Lyon lace)—there was also an evening trench in sparkly silver blue lamé satin with jeweled buttons that reprised the one shown in his fall couture show at the Lido. That one, in fact, was an iteration of a piece Mabille originally designed for his men’s collection, back when he was doing six shows a year.Elsewhere, the designer relied on cut to supply movement, for example on a T-shirt dress with a ribbon belt, or a halter dress in forget-me-not blue georgette striped with micro-sequins. The fluted sleeves that look like lace in these photos are actually cord embroidery on crin, produced by artisans the designer coaxed out of retirement to teach this technique to a new generation. Lace may be one of the trickier materials to treat with a modern touch these days, but Mabille will always be up to the challenge. “I love it,” he said. “I treat it like a second skin, and then add things to it.”', 'Stacey Bendet is over minimalism. “I really wanted to go back to this world of whimsy, but with elegance,” she said of her spring 2025 collection for Alice + Olivia. Dubbed “The Hotel of Imagination,” Bendet dreamt up a fanciful hotel, with each room taking on a different component of a collection filled with everything from the trendy (like the candy-colored striped rugby and butter yellow drop-waist maxi) to the over-the-top (the tiered corset dress with moiré polka-dots and floor-sweeping velvet burnout cape).Bendet exercises thoughtfulness when it comes to engineering her designs. This should come as no surprise, seeing as she built the brand on her search for the perfect pair of pants. This season she was expanding on her original mission with the wide-legged New Olivia pant. “It makes your butt look amazing,” she said. “Literally the best butt fit.” Furthermore, she developed the outsized floral textile to nip in at the waist, and orchestrated hidden boning in a corset to push up the breasts. She even went so far as to make the bottom tier of some of the layered dresses removable so that they may be worn from day to night. (“When you snap it off, you can wear it as a little capelet,” she said.)While the amount of the embellishment that goes into some of the pieces is admirable—such as her 3-D hand-beaded florals—it feels incongruent with downmarket finishes, such as the exposed zippers and elasticated back panels. Given the price point, consumers deserve a product that looks considered from every angle.Bendet describes her clientele as “ladies who lunch,” “Alice + Olivia boss babes,” and women in Palm Beach. “Within each print story, I always work on the prints in a way that there’s something for everyone,” she said. But while Bendet attempts to place a different kind of woman in each of her hotel’s rooms, perhaps she’d be better off serving one client.', 'Tess “I have a mind for business, and a bod for sin” McGill joined All-In’s girl gang for spring. In her dualities of character, (bimbo/brainiac), style (high/low), and class (working class/white collar), this big-shouldered business suit and sneakers-wearing fictional heroine of Working Girl (played brilliantly by Melanie Griffith), who takes the ferry from Staten Island to Wall Street, is a reflection of fashion itself.  The 1988 film engages with the idea of  projection or dressing the part, putting one’s best face forward, as well as the constructed versus “real” self. It’s no wonder that designers, whether they saw the movie in theaters, on a VHS borrowed from Blockbuster, through a streaming service, or meme, continue to be mesmerized by Tess.It’s also not surprising that Benjamin Barron and Bror August Vestbø would find such a colorful character alluring, but they weren’t only interested in Tess’s wardrobe, but also her circumstances.  Unlike the debutant and pop star of seasons past, Tess must gagner son pain—make a living—and her wardrobe must work for day and night. Similarly, the designers wanted to add an element of relatability to their work, both in terms of offering and materials. “There was something exciting about this idea of someone trying to impersonate someone from a different background,” said Barron. “I think that often our characters have this idea of something contradictory to them… there’s something about her that is both glamorous and also falling apart, and this time there’s also an element of trying to achieve some sort of version of yourself. [If] previous collections [have focused on] a very rare, very heightened moment, this one’s a bit more about that kind of attempt in everyday life.”Through a collaboration with Guess USA, All-In was able to work the most everyday material, denim, in extraordinary ways, starting with the opening look, a denim jacket constructed from three vintage ones. Digging through the denim brand’s archive, Barron and Vestbø found themselves drawn not as much to the Ellen Von Unwerth/Claudia Schiffer as Baby Bardot ’90 era, but further back to the company’s first decade (and the one that saw Anna Wintour’s first, groundbreaking Vogue cover featuring Michaela Bercu attired in Guess jeans and Christian Lacroix couture jacket).', 'The arrival of a new baby, his third with his husband, kept Joseph Altuzarra off the New York Fashion Week calendar in September. Behind the scenes, though, everything moved according to schedule; the clothes in these photos were sold to buyers starting in May, and parts of the collection will arrive in stores next month. It was designed in the same spirit as his fall runway show, which marked a creative turning point, with its rejection of “total look” fashion and emphasis on individual style. At a showroom appointment he said a pine green cropped suede jacket and long cotton chino skirt, which together exemplify his new more irreverent and more pragmatic approach, were among the season’s best sellers with his wholesalers.“The overarching thing we worked around this season was literature,” he explained. Altuzarra reads a lot of fiction and keeps up a staff book club; Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt and The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah are two recent reads. On the clothes, his love of books translated into papery textures, folding details, and prints, like the marbling motif that decorated a shirtdress, and body paintings à la Yves Klein that appeared on otherwise minimal sheaths. Other pieces were printed with fantastical images of creatures skimming over waves and mountaintops, the result of a cadavre exquis project the design studio took part in. And the exaggerated cotton eyelet that adorned the ruffled neckline of a slinky silk dress was inspired by paper crafts of the kind most of us will remember from making snowflakes in art class.Swapping a sense of control for a sense of play can make for tricksy fashion, but Altuzarra kept his designs rooted in recognizable archetypes. The papery yarns, for instance, were used for aran sweaters, while floaty organza skirts with origami-like folding details were grounded by neat tailored jackets with the defined waists of the New Look. “We still wanted it to feel like it was a lot of different people,” Altuzarra said. He let his imagination fly on an evening dress with an “almost Renaissance hip construction” and eyelet ruffles at the shoulder line that evoke bird’s wings. A look—and a collection—with a lot of main character energy.', 'School is still in session for Ambush’s Yoon Ahn, who is continuing her exploration of “Ambush Academy” for the label’s resort collection. “Fall was Ivy League, a more preppy kind of vibe; but this season we’re taking it to the quirky art class kids,” she explained on a Zoom call from Japan. “There’s more cuteness, it’s more eccentric, but there’s also a craftiness, as if we gave people ribbons and fabric and they put the clothes together themselves.”That vision shone through in basic pieces like white cotton tank tops had ribbons that tied across the chest, the purposely uneven knit of a chunky varsity-inspired cardigan, and clothes that were Frankenstein-ed together à la a button-up shirt with a knitted vest front, or the way the lining stuck out from the hem of tailored separates. There are frills galore, patchworked pieces, and a baseball sweater that reads: I’M OUT OF MY MIND PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE next to an illustration of a fairy.Pearl and crystal embellishments abound throughout. See the pearl wallet chain and lariat necklace, the spiked-bracelet made from pyramid-pearls, or the rhinestones embroidered haphazardly on jeans and less haphazardly on sheer knee-length skirts. The furry mary-janes are a sneak peek at an upcoming collaboration with Uggs. It’s a vision that recreates the exact way young people are dressing today; wearing micro-skirts with over-the knee socks, juxtaposing girly sheer twinsets with baggy sports-inspired jerseys, and sporting boxers as shorts, baby tees over slip dresses, and skirts over pants. Everything and anything goes, as long as it’s a representation of the wearer’s unique personal style.', 'It’s not the destination that matters, but the path you take to reach it. The journey is an ongoing discovery, and that’s where Andrea Adamo began his spring collection. After a season of absence, he returned to the runway thanks to the support of the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana. “I want to show the determination that drives me to keep challenging myself,” said the designer. His tears at the end of the show and the palpable emotion already present during the fittings a few days before were a reminder of how difficult it is to find a balance and to enjoy oneself when navigating the fashion system. Especially when you’re “small” and independent.Perhaps that’s why he brought his girls to a nightclub. He was on the other side of the globe last summer when he re-explored that sense of freedom that only the night can offer. The runway reflected the experience of letting go. Stripping away the inherent taboos of body sexualization, he transformed nudity into a state of mind. Nude 01, Nude 02, Nude 03, like shades of skin, are the colors that have defined his stylistic identity since day one. The clothes’ lines embraced the body’s form, approaching without constraining it, but the more form-fitting silhouettes alternated with volumes that were new in the designer’s lexicon. Miniskirts and balloon pants in georgette, sometimes open at the sides but always tight at the ankle, were paired with Aviator-style leather bombers or knitted tops, which continue to serve as a dictionary to understanding the language of Andreadamo.Layering bodysuits, garments that hide pockets, see-through organza dresses, knitwear crafted in mesh or stripes using transparent thread, stretch corsets used as bustiers over tailored suits: Everything spoke of a gritty and never predictable femininity. Sensuality burst forth in the trompe-l’œil dresses and tops, where the naked body was an optical illusion created by hand airbrushing the garments. Fringes—in knit, crunchy sequins or crystals—enhanced movement, creating precious fluid sculptures. The attitude was a kind of power dressing that became contemporary in a narrative of liberated eroticism. That’s how the collection revealed all the energy we need.', 'Outside this venue by Place de la Republique, a stunt motorcyclist was pulling somersaults on the sidewalk—even the fashion fans waiting to see Cardi B swiveled their phones in admiration. Inside, shortly afterward, Andreas Kronthaler pulled off a trick that was just as impressive: He moved this collection into an appealing new phase that was both distinctly independent of the house’s founder but also deeply in sync with her spirit and vision.The collection was called Calibrate, and it started with what Kronthaler called a retuning. For the first time since (I think) fall 2014, it was dedicated solely to womenswear. This fundamentally changed the emphasis for a line that had long offered clothes the genders could freely (if sometimes daringly) swap. “But these are clothes that are built for a woman, not a man, to wear,” he said. Also for the first time in ages, a few period touches apart, it looked like there were no overt historical stories or references. “No, for once. It’s just clothes, clothes that I think symbolize a very powerful, feminine woman, which I think we are looking for and need more than anything,” said Kronthaler.There has been a broader runway reassessment of feminine sexiness at play this season, and refreshingly no orthodoxy has emerged, because cookie cutter won’t cut it in such subjective and myriad territory. Vivienne Westwood was always Kronthaler’s muse and subject, but now, her absence real—“But she is still here, everywhere, around”—he was ready to apply some of the great technical codes of the house to a broader constituency.The collection featured multiple subversions of bourgeois classics, focusing on construction over surface. A wrap dress in pale lilac was rippled with tumultuous layers of irregular drape. A one-shoulder layered check dress with a scalloped hem and a track-pants tie at the neckline was technical-boho. A blue wool jacket was given a powerfully wide shoulder and a drunken cut that lurched most woozily at the extended skirt that fell from between its two vents. Knits and crepes was drawn across the body in essentially conventional ways, but with an elaboration of attitude achieved by an emphasis of scale and a skewing of angle. There was the occasional easy gesture, such as the cutout at the bottom of one knit dress, but more often Kronthaler was dressing complication within simplicity.It’s been eight years since Kronthaler’s name was added to the marquee billing of this line: Before, it was named Vivienne Westwood Gold Label, and in fact two of the looks today were made of an upcycled lining from that period. This afternoon, more than ever before, Kronthaler etched his identity to the forefront of this part of the Vivienne Westwood offer—because there is still the second collection showing via look book through the studio in London. As Kronthaler put it: “I’ve always been referring, you know: Would she like it? Is this what she would do? What would she choose? But then, in the end, also less so now.” Changing things up and forging forward seems absolutely appropriate to the Westwood tradition.', 'On Saturday night, the Ann Demeulemeester show took place in a hulled-out modern building flanking the Montparnasse train station. One day it will become offices and a school. But for now it offers up a large, rough-hewn space with a very long runway, lined on this occasion with a trail of white lilies. It was pretty, if a tad funereal. On every seat was an envelope with a moody “Wall of Reference” printed in black and white. It name-checked Hunter S. Thompson, medieval poet François Villon, Dennis Hopper, Jack Kerouac, and Stevie Nicks, among others. Nicks’s handwritten lyrics for “Rhiannon” appeared on the last page. There was a musical introduction by way of a live performance on electric guitar. That was pretty long too.What was clear is that creative director Stefano Gallici, now three seasons into his role, is feeling more at home. During a preview, the designer explained that he came to fashion through music, namely punk, indie, and garage. At the time, he played in a band (My Bloody Valentine and Dinosaur Jr. were favorites), and his mother was a major Fleetwood Mac fan. While he chose to dive back into his teenage obsessions, this collection wasn’t just about his own experience, he said. The brand—part mindscape, part autobiography—has attracted a younger community that’s highly engaged and constantly evolving.“It was unexpected, even to me, but this young tribe feels seen [by us],” he said. “We touch the kids who don’t recognize themselves in the contemporary music field, and they want to express what they stand for in fashion and art. What I want to bring them is not just a series of shows and collections, but also a musical and cultural landscape.”Gallici doesn’t particularly relish the term muse, but it’s fair to say that Nicks, notably in her Bella Donna period, struck the dominant chord for spring. Models and musicians—Shane Hawkins among them—emerged in moody looks leavened by powder pink, lilac, mauve, and very pretty pieces in chiffon lasered into English eyelet. There was a lashing of New Romanticism, flou floral silks, and hammered satins, paired variously with distressed, patched, and embroidered denim, hand-distressed jersey, and pants cut on the bias. Gallici said he was using the rawness of lace on bare skin, feathery knits, deconstructed and inside-out tailoring, and slouch to conjure a feeling of absent-mindedness—or what he called the “endless possibilities of lost and found.”Whatever that means, Gallici arguably conjured all the hits in a way that should prove commercial. It’s the kind of music the Ann Demeulemeester crowd knows when they hear it. They were out in force on Saturday, all dressed up and ready to follow wherever the night may lead. They took the lilies with them.', 'This season fashion has largely chosen to react to the current sociopolitical and economic chaos with a kind of peaceful protest expressed through softness and prettiness. These attributes are, of course, often found in lingerie, by which Anna October is always inspired. “My constant thinking is about the female body and femininity and how we can use clothes as liberating instruments,” she said on a walk-through. Soft power, then.That October and her Ukraine-based team continue to keep the faith in the face of the unimaginable challenges they face is remarkable and laudable. Some people find solace in gardening; this season it was part of October’s inspiration. Top of mind were “life cycles” and how a garden is “blooming, then it’s dying, then new things are coming,” she explained. “I think that in times of big changes in the world, in times of cataclysms, the only way to keep sane and to keep growing as a human is to build something beautiful.”How does October’s garden grow for spring? The signature tulip brassiere detail was back. Some of the silken, bias-cut slip dresses featured tiny floral bead embroideries as delicate as the hand-painted porcelain (think Meissen) they referenced. A more personal memory of Linden blooming in May resulted in an embroidery of that flower. Several crochet dresses featured pendant blooms.There were also a number of then-now hybrids for spring. Sometimes it seems as if October is in dialogue with Madeleine Vionnet as she refines and refines her bias-cut slip dresses. “I’m constantly in the process of developing that dress,” she noted. A black-and-white number could be for a latter day Joan Crawford, much like the first look with what might be the season’s most sensual back, with arches inspired by the architecture in Kiev, updates that brought a Jean Harlow vibe in a manner that felt now rather than vintage.There were playful looks as well: See a meringue-like pink bustier paired with a full skirt with a ruffle-edged dropped yoke. The final three looks spoke to a more pared-back and sophisticated aesthetic. A gold knit dress that a colleague thought fit for a Joan of Arc was knit of a yarn so fine that it resembled metal mesh. More romantic, yet at the same time somehow restrained, was an embellished cape of a nearly sheer Japanese taffeta.Moving beyond the floaty and slippery materials she usually favors, October used jersey, which clings to the body rather than skims it as satin does, to craft a long white dress with a tank silhouette that extended down to a triangular basque waistline from which the softly gathered fabric falls. This look was an invitation to dance, to glide through the world with confidence and grace. It was mindful, body conscious, not demure—and all the better for it.', 'Anna Sui has five fragrances launching in the fall, so she’ll do a presentation of her new collection then. Her show at the Strand last season was a highlight of New York, but if it was disappointing not to see these clothes in motion on the runway, a visit to her Garment District office and showroom made up for it.Sui’s mood board is always teeming with references. This time around it was Andy Warhol’s early commercial art she was drawn to. “I wanted to do something really soft, and I’ve always loved his pre-Pop drawings,” she said. They informed the pastel color palette as well as the prints. Sui enlisted the artist Paul LeRoy Gehres, whose personal work often channels Warhol’s, to create a cherub logo motif. You may see it on the shrunken ’90s tees that Sui’s young fans are now collecting. She also pointed out a new printing technique that evoked the blotted outlines of Warhol’s illustrations on a pretty lace slip dress.Travel, resorts, and country clubs were on Sui’s mind. If you’ve ever come across photos of your mother or grandmother on vacation at the beach in the ’60s, you’ll get her drift. In the mix were terry lounge sets, A-line micro-shifts in fluorescent jacquards and floral piqués, souvenir print silk-cotton voile pajamas, cardigans that “look like something Dean Martin would’ve worn,” and bejeweled cat-eye sunglasses. The ruffled pastel tulle prom dresses were a sweet alternative to the too-old-for-them styles many high schoolers are wearing now.Sui mentioned that her actor-niece Chase Sui Wonders had been by the studio to see the collection. “‘Auntie Anna,’” she said, “‘it’s like the opposite of brat, it’s so earnest, it’s demure.’ She kind of got it,” said Sui. She really did. And for the record, Wonders said that “before the whole demure quote came out.”', 'Previous anOnlyChild lookbooks were shot in a home environment, nodding at the low-key vibes that define Maxwell Osborne’s clothes, but this season he opted to let the city invigorate his designs. It was a smart choice.“The idea,” he said, “was really to show city life and capture this girl in New York that isn’t dolled-up and frilly.” The images were taken by the photographer Tyler Joe, a fixture of the street style scene at New York Fashion Week, and they do feel like street style shots, contextualizing the pieces in ways that people might wear them in real life. The runways can push designers to present their work in a manner that doesn’t always befit them—clothes are often too styled, too dramatic, too glamorized. Osborne’s oversized track separates, bulbous bomber jackets, and wide, double-pleat trousers, in particular, looked fantastic in movement and with the streets of New York as their backdrop.New this season were a silky tailored shirtdress and a couple of dresses and skirts with fun bubble hems representing a new more mature outlook on femininity. Sadly not pictured was a very special gown. Backless in striped cotton with a puffy hem that grazed the floor, it’s the kind of outfit that would make even a frantic New Yorker look twice.', 'It was impossible not to notice that under the black nylon Anrealage-branded jacket he was wearing backstage before this show, Kunihiko Morinaga had gained some major bulk. His torso had the unlikely volume of some old-school circus strongman. The secret to the designer’s transformation sat just above the hem of his jacket: a one- or two-inch diameter fan that drew in air and gently inflated the garment.As Morinaga explained, “air-con clothing” has been a thing in Japan for several years. After much trial and error it was invented and perfected by former Sony engineer Hiroshi Ichigaya (check the entertaining profile on nippon.com) as a new form of cooling workwear. The idea is that the constantly refreshed aura of air encircling the body allows for the speedy evaporation of sweat and the maintenance of a bearable temperature. Enthusiastic clients from the construction sector and other hard-working, weather-exposed industries have enabled Ichigaya’s 2004-founded company Kuchofuku to expand almost as rapidly as its garments when they inflate: The category it pioneered is now worth more than $140 million a year in sales.Which brings us back to Anrealage. Morinaga’s first three models came out in loose, drapey and opaque romper suits in white, pink and blue. When the fans (which can be controlled via app) were started the ultralight nylon garments inflated—and the audience was rightly wowed. Applause still rang as further sections followed. Prints showed the graphic elements of polka-dot, check and houndstooth as if they’d been windblown like autumn leaves. These had been printed with a water-free process named Forearth invented by another Morinaga collaborator, Kyocera. We saw a section of amusingly steroid-enormous track-jackets before Morinaga really found his own creative wind by applying an artistic agenda to Ichigaya’s pragmatic invention.Morinaga used the inflationary pressure of the Ichigaya process to create shapes that were semi-abstract, but also evocative of insects, flowers, birds and coral. Fabrics included what looked like a tweed, but mostly stuck to the parachute lightness of nylon. Powerfully unfamiliar, these would be a challenging wear in a banal and daily context for anybody who wilts under scrutiny. Yet accompanied by Jakops’s specially-composed, urgently uplifting soundtrack it was easy to see these Anrealage pieces absolutely in their element on some loopily enhanced midsummer’s dancefloor. The shapes Morinaga was throwing were fun and fascinating. And in the sweltering closeness of the Palais de Tokyo basement space we were watching them in, the appeal “air-con clothing” technology was obvious.', \"Every season for many seasons Antonio Marras has unearthed a compelling story from his home island of Sardinia, then spun a collection around it. This time was no different, but the story was even better than usual. It concerned Anna Maria Pierangeli, a Cagliari born actor who was “discovered” and went to Hollywood in the 1950s, where she met and fell in love with James Dean. The story is much better told here, but the short take is that there was no happily ever after.Marras put us in a club, complete with in-house doo-wop band on a glittery stage and an energetic bunch of guys and dolls jiving enthusiastically during a typically overlong introductory section. The collection blended all of Marras’s highly appealing standard techniques and modalities with a this-season layering of 1950s teen fashion and tropicana (a vibe justified by references to Pierangeli's apparent love for vacationing in Acapulco).Pompadoured boys wore handsome South Pacific khaki fatigues with articulated sleeves and prints or patches of orchids and pearls. There were jacquard organza animalia short-and-shirt sets, print-patchwork short-and-shirt sets, embroidered Sardinian postcard motif shirts (for Pierangeli’s imagined postcards from home) and some great tropical print sets featuring rolling surf and rumbling red motorcycles.The womenswear featured rattan parasol hats, multicolored many-tiered fringe dresses, and cinch-waisted and bodiced swing dresses in a Marras-typical multitude of pattern and texture. The knee-high, mid-denier stocking-socks worn by most models featured a back seam that morphed into the designer’s name midcalf: clever. Shaggy fringe feather-wrap dresses and car coats came in soft rainbow tones. Leathers in eggplant purple or olive green, and a cool swing skirt and bomber in incongruously fluoro green—a pleasant jolt—were among the many other highlights in this highly evocative show.Fashion currently lacks great runway storytellers: Many houses with wonderful histories seem barely aware of them, let alone how to articulate them via shows and clothes. Marras is an absolute maestro at spinning yarns through garments—even if he could sometimes use an editor.\", '“It might not be much, but a window that opens onto the street is all I need,” said Arthur Arbesser. He’s always been obsessed with windows, watching life unfold through the glass when the lights turn on at night. The place where he presented his spring 2025 collection felt like a small white box, with synthetic grass replaced tiles on the floor. But an unnoticeable door on the other side of the shop window opened into an unexpected dimension that felt intimate yet communal. That space led to the back entrance of the studio of Turi Simeti, one of the most influential Italian artists of the 20th century, a master of abstractionism who transformed the simple oval into his own language.“Magic often comes from things that seem very small. This collection was born while looking around us: it’s always surprising to discover that what surrounds us can turn into an emotional fabric on which to build something,” said Arbesser. The hands of Francesco, one of his interns, became the starting point for an aesthetic exploration of everyday symbols. When giving flowers or writing postcards thoughts become gestures through hands, and Arbesser transformed those gestures into a collage print, a recurring motif in the collection. Along with Post-it notes, bar wall tiles, and checkered napkins, they reflected a reduction of the unnecessary to explore simplicity. “Fashion has become an industry where numbers and size seem to be the things that matter most, but to us small feels right, small feels wise,” said the designer.There were fabric remnants dyed orange in the studio shower, taffeta translated into easy-to-wear pieces, and old photos of animals turned into psychedelic prints. But also poker chips bought at flea markets used as jewelry and sculptural hats drawn with an irregular rhythm: Arthur Arbesser knows how to play with the system and its rules. And he knows how to have fun and how to make people have fun. While designing homewear or creating costumes for the Opera House, he takes care of a mental space that allows him to feel free, “even if thinking freely is a bit anti-Milanese,” he said. However, his greatest gift remains the naïvete of one that offers apricot juice or Coca-Cola to friends and clients, drawn in by the sense of warmth and eclectic storytelling. Because that’s precisely what he dresses people in.', 'There’s so much to British creativity. Ashish Gupta entrusted the art direction of this look book to former Fashion East-ers James Theseus Buck and Luke Brooks of Rottingdean Bazaar, along with photographer Annie Collinge. This is the same trio that won this year’s Grammy for best recording package.Gupta explained that after enduring some gut-wrenching business turbulence following the demise of Matches Fashion, he decided to leave London for India, where his family and factories are based, and cloister himself in design. “It was very therapeutic, actually,” he said. “Because making the clothes is the best part of this for me. And the workshop in India was like an ideas lab: We tried something new every day.”Revived, he returned to England with this collection: “And trying all these new techniques made me think of the power of audacity, experimentation, and lightness. These are the same attributes that I think you need to survive as an independent in this industry, especially in the UK right now. So that’s why I wanted some lightness in this shoot.” Hence his commission.That lightness absolutely carried over into a humorous and subversively self-interrogating lookbook that ingeniously centered around a mannequin the artists had bought on eBay. They said: “We thought about the most functional aspects and purposes of lookbooks and how we could experiment with and emphasize those.” With their trademark mordant wit they placed their obviously lifeless model in locales that served to ingeniously and incongruously mirror Gupta’s gorgeous garments. The resulting images were full of gags: some of these were obvious, others more nuanced.So a look shot against a colorfully lumpy Brighton climbing wall was patched with irregularly shaped scraps and swatches of hand-embroidered fabric sourced from Gupta’s own development archive: these scraps included grails he’d made when he was starting out 20 years ago. A long organza dress was embroidered with sequined flowers that became progressively droopier and more wilted across the garment; this looked as if Collinge had shot it on the appropriately overgrown grassy shoulder of a highway. Memories of struggling to complete a polka-dot project under the tutelage of swear-y legend Professor Louise Wilson had inspired Gupta to make the bias-cut chiffon T-shirt dress whose dots were all hand-drawn on the garment before being filled with sequins. This was shot against a spotted wall.  “I wanted to embrace the imperfection of the process in order to showcase the analog reality of the handicraft,” he said. Enhanced by its endearingly eccentric presentation—this was all analog reality, no Photoshop—Gupta’s wit, determination, and skill was writ large in this excellent collection. If you get it, you get it.', 'As Britney Spears’s “Overprotected” blasted from the speakers at Ashley Williams’s spring show, models came down the runway in adult-size baby rompers, Sailor Moon–esque dresses, and an array of pieces covered in a vintage-inspired bunny print. “The main inspiration was [the idea of] exploring different parts of yourself, different ways in which you show up in the world,” the designer explained backstage following the show.The opening looks explored the “emotionally immature character,” hence the babyish feel. Then came the “idealized version of yourself,” represented by superhero-like dresses featuring large keyhole cutouts and combs adorning the long blonde wigs and several of the dresses—signaling, in Williams’s mind, someone who is “fully functioning” and in control (in contrast to those trying to hide behind their hair via wigs that covered half the models’ faces).Then there was the “boundaryless, angry, vulnerable” character, signified by the leather breastplate and matching skirt embossed with the outline of a gun. The motif—also emblazoned across dresses and a tracksuit top and skirt—felt somewhat jarring, particularly alongside a cap and T-shirt printed with the slogan “Happiest girl in the world” next to bloody bullet wounds.Still, there was much for the brand’s loyal fan base, many of whom were at the show, to get excited about, from the dalmatian skirt to the cutesy shoulder bags. Williams is a master at universe building: it’s her world, and we’re all just living in it.', 'At Cristina Grajales Gallery, Ashlynn Park presented a collection among design objects she had curated from the gallery’s collection. This juxtaposition of old and new objects paralleled the designer’s overall process for spring 2025, which began, she said, “with revisiting the history of fashion.” Her icons are Madame Grès, Christian Dior, Azzedine Alaïa (whose collection Park visited recently), and Yohji Yamamoto (with whom Park once worked). Their work, she explained, “always gives a right and clear answer when I face a challenge. I feel like we have so many challenges and we constantly look to the future, but the answers and the solutions are often already there [in the past].”Since she launched her line, Park’s work has often been compared to that of Yamamoto (who has himself taken fashion history as a theme), and that will likely be the reaction to Park’s take on the tuxedo, a one-button mid-length black coat with a bit of an hourglass shape that’s an explosion black and white at the back as the shirt and coat back dance together. Park is familiar with the famous bustle backed coat that was recently exhibited in Milan, but it was seeing how meticulously Alaïa had engineered a shirt and jacket that inspired her smoking look.Park spent a month and a half getting the tension right in a black, draped Grecian gown a la Grès in jersey with a rolled detail at the waist. (Another version, in red, was nicely styled over a simple long-sleeved top.)  Like a trim eel-skin tunic and an asymmetric leather corset top, these gowns made use of the designer’s puzzle-piece technique.Television show or no, Christian Dior is a constant reference for Park. Her take on the iconic Bar jacket jettisoned the padded hips; rather the hip panniers floated on a cloud of tulle and exposed boning that topped a long, draped skirt. This was a take-the-stuffing-out-of-things moment. Under the jacket was a simple bra.  Similar in silhouette, but not construction, was a white sleeveless dress with a romantic peplum made using a no-waste technique in which squares of material are connected.The looks in the second room stood like the Erechtheion’s Porch of the Maidens caryatids at the Acropolis. It was easy to imagine Chessy Rayner or Mica Ertegun gravitating to a black column dress with a Fontana-like slash of white. The combination of new, more evening-focused designs with more familiar, and in the case of a kilt and a shirtdress, casual looks, was discordant, regardless of the appeal of the individual pieces.Park’s exploration of past fashion included her own back catalog, specifically spring 2023, which featured a performance by the dancer and choreographer Yin Yue. This season’s take on the past work was a jersey jumpsuit with a slightly-low, V-shaped yoke and draped harem-style pants. It was styled with a bandeau-like cardigan that revealed a sliver of skin at the shoulder. There was something rather Martha Graham about this look; at the same time, it was of the moment, as a similar silhouette, derived from different sources was seen at Alaïa by Pieter Mulier and at Norma Kamali. The idea of softly gathered material that accommodates movement is related, more broadly, to freedom.', 'Antonin Tron of Atlein—the label that received a huge and\\xa0well-deserved visibility boost this past week when Tron’s collaboration with Kylie Jenner’s Khy line was finally revealed, and all I can say is about time, because Tron and his label are the real deal—is feeling toughness, and he wanted to do outerwear and suiting for the first time. In a nutshell, that’s his cause and effect for spring boiled down to the simplest of terms.Yet this is Tron we’re speaking about, a designer whose excellent, intelligent, and emotionally nuanced clothes are the result of him really thinking and really feeling—and then really designing. At face value, what we had here were the likes of slope-shouldered mannish jackets that had been gathered with shirring in the waist at the back, worn with wide trousers; waxed-cotton trenches whose hems might trail the floor at any moment, maybe thrown over his impeccably bias-draped dresses; and cargo pants worn with everything from cropped MA1-style flight jackets to crystal-studded draped tops.Quite a few things here came encrusted with those sparkly little stones. This was a new sense of embellishment from Tron, whose impulse to decorate in the past was to show you all the brilliant ways he can drape. But have no fear, there was still plenty of that here too. Uniting all of this: the tough-as-F combat boots that came with so many of his looks.Backstage preshow, Tron discussed what had been on his mind as he worked on the spring collection. His mood board was a collage of images of a strident, hectoring Siouxsie Sioux at her best (be still my beating heart; I love her and her music) in full Queen of Punk regalia; Catherine Deneuve in The Hunger; the 2021 documentary Rebel Dykes; and artist Del LaGrace, with Tron referencing their 1991 book, Love Bites, which celebrated lesbian erotica through the lens of a fierce questioning stance on gender roles. (Tron seemed surprised that I knew LaGrace’s work, but then he wasn’t at art school in London in the early ’90s when radical queerness shaped an awful lot of conversation time.)In many ways, part of Tron’s work has been to interrogate his own role as a male designer creating for women. In the lead-up to designing this collection, he had been, he said, “reading a lot about the history of feminism and feminist writers, and that led me to Rebel Dykes, and it was amazing to see this group of radical lesbians had created this safe space, a club called Chain Reaction”—I remember it well—“fighting homophobia and misogyny. I am a designer for women; I can’t not look at the history of feminism.”As for how his own gender plays out in his design-as-allyship, Tron mentioned how so many thinkers have presented an idea of gender as performance, and that being something he readily identifies and agrees with. In the same way, he felt it was time to challenge himself. “I wanted to express another side of myself, of my personality,” Tron said. “To show I’m more than a maker of dresses.”', '“Made in Italy” is a broad umbrella concept under which innumerable smaller bottegas (workshops) sit—from tailors to textile makers to specialists who work with leather, raffia, and other materials. It would seem, then, that differences of scale on the production end are a given, so why are so few piccolo-size brands on or adjacent to the Fashion Week schedule? They do exist.\\xa0One of them is ATXV, a three-year-old unisex line founded by Antonio Tarantini, a man with decades of experience working alongside industry giants like John Galliano, Domenico Dolce, and Donatella Versace. The designer, who drapes by hand, has a great sensitivity to materials, especially when it comes to their transparencies, weights, and luster. One of his see-through Lurex numbers was worn by Italian singer and fashion leader Mahmood, as well as in Dua Lipa’s “Illusion” music video. Twisting and draping are Tarantini’s signature techniques, and they were well displayed when Paloma Elsesser appeared on the cover of\\xa0M: Le Monde\\xa0in one of his neo-Grecian dresses. “I am not a fan of clothes that constrict your body,” said the designer on a call. “Maybe because I worked so much with those kinds of clothes, I now prefer to work with effortless shapes.”\\xa0\\xa0Madame Grès, fashion’s classicist nonpareil, is, and has been, having a moment. Models are floating down runways in gathered jersey dresses with fluid movement left and right. Tarantini’s take on the ancient world is a bit sexier and more obviously physical; you won’t find sfogliatelle-like pleats here. Rather, the excitement comes from the way the fabric has been twisted and pulled, and the contrast between where it’s been pulled taut or left loose. There’s a clear sense that hands have touched the cloth. Given the times, Tarantini wanted, he said, “to give something strong, but in a really soft way.”Among his starting points were summer wardrobe essentials like the classic white cotton T-shirt and tank.\\xa0He reimagined the former in several ways, including for a side-zipped draped skirt. Tarantini devised one of the best takes on the season’s ubiquitous tank; his was made of a opaque cotton. Another knit version had rolled hems at the waist and sleeves. An asymmetric draped one-piece dress-up-or-down dress (Look 15) had a tank strap on one shoulder and a spaghetti strap on the other.', 'Oops!…she did it again—or something like that. Avavav’s Beate Karlsson charmed and challenged the fashion establishment afresh with an offbeat show format—but let’s be clear, there was no oops factor involved. In fact, the odds of this small, women-led company based in Stockholm making waves in one of the big four cities are close to none. And so the designer (who trained in New York and worked for Pyer Moss before returning to Europe) has turned her point of difference, namely her digital fluency, into a defining aspect of her brand.Avavav is not the only millennial or Gen Alpha brand speaking directly to its peer audience (see Vain, for example), but Karlsson is unique in her use of fashion as a two-way mirror. Her designs are casual: mostly jeans, statement T-shirts, and streetwear—with a difference. Her shoulderless hoodies, worn Conehead style, have been very influential, as have her finger shoes, in which Rick Owens has been photographed out and about. Denim comes in interesting washes, and an elephant-leg effect is created by tucking the flared bottoms of the pants.Karlsson, like many designers this season, turned her attention to sports. Her motivation was a collaboration with Adidas. “It’s been a dream of mine to collaborate with them, specifically,” she said on a call. She “dedicated the show to the partnership because it is a big deal for us and a lot of the looks are going to be showing the product that we’ve made with them.” This is a big deal, because not only is Avavav a relatively small business, but, in 2024, there are so few women invited into the streetwear space. And, as the designer noted, “There are a lot of interesting things that can come from bringing feminine attributes into streetwear.” She proved that today.To frame the collaboration, Karlsson held her show in a sports arena. The concept was that the models would “compete” to beat the world record in the 100 meters. The tagline: “High fashion and low performance.” For Avavav fans, the models’ stumbling will feel like a reference to the viral spring 2023 show at which every model fell (on purpose). Although only a section of the track was used, the choice of event and the full oval could easily be read as a metaphor for the fashion industry as a whole and the circularity, inwardness, and repetition of its set cycles. Karlsson does find some irony in fashion’s pursuit of athleticism, but she was coming from a more benign mindset. “There’s a lot of curiosity and seriousness and rules within the fashion industry, and there’s a lot of seriousness and rules within sports as well, so it’s been fun to try to mix them,” she said.', \"This season in New York, many designers have been feeling unusually glum. Backstage, many of the week’s top talents have spoken candidly of looking to fashion for joy and upliftment—especially at a time when tensions are at a high with the coming U.S. election, and the economy continues to falter. Bach Mai, too, has been in that mood. “This last year has been the hardest of my life,” said Mai backstage before his own show. “It’s harder than ever for young designers right now.” For spring, then, Mai desperately needed a mood boost in his studio—and he found his happiness by injecting his signature evening dresses and red carpet gowns with a heavy dose of bright, upbeat colors. “I wanted it to be about clawing through that darkness—there’s not a stitch of black,” said Mai, who shared an inspiration quote from Albert Camus for the season: “In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.”Mai’s sugary color palette for spring certainly could put a smile on the most sour of faces. Referencing the work of artist James Turrell and the Mexican architect Luis Barragán, Mai zeroed in on an evening collection that played with shades of bright reds, oranges, pinks, and seafoam greens. “I love Barragán’s profound use of color, which is bold and subtle at the same time,” he said. The mix was pretty much the fashion equivalent of taking an upper. The brazen hues worked especially well on Mai’s more pared-back designs, like a strapless bodice gown with a cascading tulle skirt in red, pink, and purple; and one of his strongest looks, a gauzy white sleeveless top with a cascading back train, styled over a pale-green micro short—a minty-fresh combo.Many of Mai's gala-ready creations this season served as the his interpretation of American glamour (see: his colorful organza “jeans”), though he also infused elements of mid-century haute couture and traditional Japanese Bijinga art. The problem with doing couture, however, is that things need to be tailored and fit to perfection: some of Mai’s more complicated designs, like his deep-V dresses with swishy pleated skirts, had evident fit problems at the bust. His materials, of course, were as luxe as ever—finished in sumptuous failles, moirés, and satins. “We wanted lightness,” he said, but at times his ambitious cuts distracted from the beautiful materials and colors he chose to make them in. Some details, like the thick bands across the butt, or the leather gloves, or the ropes tied at the waist, also seemed to be there just to be there. But the maximalism will likely be appreciated by Mai’s growing celebrity clientele (he recently dressed Amal Clooney in Venice). As one head-turning look came after the next, you could easily see them sparking joy at the Oscars or the Emmys.\", 'For spring 2025, Mark Badgley and James Mischka called upon a beloved, oft-referenced fashion muse: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But we aren’t talking about Camelot here. The duo behind Badgley Mischka peered beyond the White House and into her marriage to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. They were specifically interested in Onassis’s famed yacht, the Christina O, which even informed their venue choice of the Greek restaurant Periyali. (“It looks kind of like the interior of the Christina with the lacquered wood,” Mischka said. “I thought that looked nautical,” Badgley agreed.)“It takes us from Marbella to Malta to Mykonos,” Mischka said of the collection, an offering filled with brightly colored florals in neoprene, beaded embellishments stitched onto silk mikado, faux wrap dresses, and—of course—many a caftan. “We love caftans,” Badgely said. “We do a lot of caftans, especially for our Middle Eastern customers.”The pair made a concerted effort to reinvent the cocktail dress this season, in an apparent attempt to appeal to a younger clientele. “Marilyn Monroe says, ‘I just love finding new ways to wear diamonds,’” Mischka said, paraphrasing a line from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. “We want new ways to wear our evening clothes.” One option they presented was a sleeveless tuxedo jacket over tap shorts, printed in a black-and-purple floral scuba fabrication. “It’s fun for a girl that was going to a fresh, young, sexy cocktail party [who] doesn’t wear a cocktail dress,” Badgley said. “This to us is a very modern, feminine tuxedo—comfortable, stylish, classic cocktail.”But as the saying goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. While it was a laudable effort to draw in a younger consumer, Badgley Mischka is at its best when it designs for the women who have stayed loyal to it over all these years. Badgley nailed the brief when he gestured to a salmon-hued dress with a sheer, flowing marocain column over a Georgette underlayer: “Easy, glamorous, tall.”', '“The time has come for fashion to have a point of view.” That was the straightforward message Demna delivered backstage today at Balenciaga.The show we had just witnessed played out in a darkened room, on a polished dining table lined on both sides with editors in chief, celebrities from Nicole Kidman to Katy Perry, and Balenciaga and Kering management. His grandmother’s table is where Demna discovered he was interested in clothes as a young boy in Georgia. “My earliest memories of fashion start with me drawing looks on cardboard, cutting them out, and making ‘fashion shows,’” he wrote in a note distributed to the press.Demna may have been trying to reconnect with his inner child, but there was nothing guileless about this collection. A significant portion was dedicated to the cocoon silhouette, one of Cristóbal Balenciaga’s icons. It’s a shape Demna said he finds too retro if done literally, so he applied it to the cropped puffers and bombers of the under-25 set and teamed them with jeans that barely clung to jutting hip bones. A pair of pieces that came later also hewed to Cristóbal’s striking sculptural lines but pushed the experimentation further. Built to be ingeniously multipurpose, the men’s featured what Demna called a “Medici collar from the 17th century” that was actually a corset “engineered into the neckline”; the women’s starred the same jacket, only it was worn as a leather bustier top. And yes, on Looks 49 and 50 were jeans starched stiff and standing in for turned-up lapels.Riffing on an evening dress made entirely from bras shown for fall, Demna created assemblages that looked thrown together. “I like the mess,” he said. “I think the fashion world is trying to be so perfect and polished and impeccable in everything…but that’s not how fashion is for me. Fashion needs to get messed up. It needs to get fucked up…. It needs to not be based on fear.” It was the most unambiguous précis of the industry we heard all season.Walking the talk, Demna opened the show with lingerie, a trending category for spring 2025 (“It’s a no-clothes season,” a fellow runway watcher weighed in post-show) but one he’s never really explored. “My aesthetic is not based on that kind of very direct sex appeal or that kind of fragility,” he said. And so, of course, he turned the proposition on its head by layering or embroidering the bras and teddies and garters on flesh-colored body stockings. “It’s trompe l’oeil,” he said. You can see the idea catching on.On a parallel track, together with his team he came up with a clever hinging mechanism that allowed them to make barely-there tops that clicked on around the rib cage, leaving the whole expanse of the back exposed. Talking about that innovation backstage, Demna genuinely did sound as charged up and enthusiastic as a little kid.', \"With the precision of a Swiss watchmaker, as one would expect from the creative director of a brand based in the Alpine country, Simone Bellotti mastered his spring collection with the sharp-edged grace that’s becoming his trademark. It was a compelling showcase that solidified Bally's quietly emerging fashion cred.At a preview, Bellotti’s moodboard featured an eclectic mix of imagery, but one portrait stood out, that of Hugo Ball, the sound-poetry author and founder of the Dada movement in 1916 Zürich. Surrounding Ball’s image were photos of rustic, oddly-shaped cowbells, rusted shoehorns, and Man Ray’s artwork The Gift—a flat iron with thumbtacks glued along its sole. What captivated Bellotti about Ball’s portrait was the striking costume: a tall cylindrical hat and a metallic cone-shaped cape, with a stiff high collar framing his face. “I like its simple precision,” Bellotti remarked.Bellotti revisited the mountain-like, sloped-shoulder silhouette throughout the collection, integrating it into the necklines of coats and blazers. In some ensembles, this shape was paired with curved lines inspired by cowbells, reinterpreted as rounded miniskirts—some of which were lifted at the front to reveal matching culottes beneath. A standout was a burgundy leather coat featuring a sloped collar and shoulders, with a cinched waist that flared into a poufy pannier skirt.Bellotti said his intent was to focus on experimenting with form. Though crafted from structure-retaining materials, the pieces did not appear rigid; rather, they conveyed an off-kilter fragility, like a sort of impractical Swiss couture, lyrical and somewhat anarchic, reminiscent of a Dadaist performance. Said Bellotti: “Dadaism was about a sense of play, and gentle subversion. What I’m looking for is finding equilibrium between rationality and whimsy.”\", '“I actually think the face is the sexiest part of a woman’s body.” So said Olivier Rousteing to Into The Gloss back in 2012. That was Rousteing’s first full year as creative director of Balmain, which he’d first joined in 2009, and first shown for in September 2011. Tonight, backstage, he said: “I didn’t know [then] I would still be with you talking about this incredible brand. I think the recipe of fashion is to not be trendy. The recipe of fashion is to be you.”This evening’s Balmain show was about Rousteing being Rousteing. He referred back to the fiercely pointy shoulders and intensely worked detail that first emerged at the house when he was assistant to predecessor Christophe Decarnin, and which upon his accession he embraced and amplified. The marinière stripe, both a fundamental French trope and reflective of Rousteing’s Bordelais upbringing, was there too. Rousteing was the first Black lead designer at a Paris luxury house, and his long-term commitment to broadening fashion’s spectrum tonight, as last season, looked especially to include women from across multiple generations on his runway.However this evening’s Balmain show was also very much about a key moment that Rousteing has long been working towards. Back in 2012, Balmain was only eight years clear of a bankruptcy scare, and still sold solely ready-to-wear: That year it posted revenues of just over €30 million. By last year, the range of categories had broadened to include bags, eyewear, sneakers, kidswear and more, and revenues had increased over tenfold. Tonight, though, was Rousteing’s runway declaration that Balmain has re-entered the broadest luxury category of all: beauty. Which brings us back to the start.The face images in the dresses, jackets and shorts were rendered by the hand-embroidering of hundreds of thousands of pearlescent beads. The multi-toned, multi-textural dress and top in looks 31 and 32 were wearable mascara palettes. Many of the looks reflected the ridged and glossy flagons of the recently launched Les Éternels throwback heritage Balmain fragrance range. These also inspired heels and bag hardware. Sometimes the models more straightforwardly carried the fragrances. In the audience was William P. Lauder, executive chairman of Estée Lauder Companies, Balmain’s new long-term global beauty licensee and partner—rarely, if ever, could he have witnessed such a fully-expressed runway embrace. Rousteing delivered a non-metaphorical runway embrace to Brigitte Macron, a habitual Balmain wearer, before a finale spritz of draped silk dresses in multiple tonal shades. “This show is me,” said Rousteing, the essence of Balmain.', 'Social media is a good thing sometimes. “I get Instagram direct messages from clients saying ‘I got this dress from you 10 years ago, but I still love it so much and I’m still wearing it’,” Barbara Tfank explained during a recent appointment. It made the designer realize that if she continues to make beautiful well-made dresses, then her customers will continue wearing them for years to come.This season, she focused on bright gelato-like colors of yellows, pinks, and chartreuse to create a 12-piece collection of summer-ready looks suitable for everywhere from the Hamptons to Palm Beach. Highlights included a cap-sleeved metallic pink gown that could just as easily work in the daytime as in the nighttime and was made to just throw in your suitcase and go. Tfank also experimented with raffia, but instead of the usual matte and straw-like look and feel, it was dipped in gold by fabric artisans in Italy for a sparkly touch.', 'For official purposes, the Batsheva spring 2025 show took place at her store on Elizabeth Street. But in real life, Batsheva Hay and her cohort of models and co-conspirators took over Elizabeth Street entirely. They waited for a red light, blocked the crosswalk, and then out came a violinist, performing Shania Twain’s “You’re Still the One,” along with her group of 16 models, all carrying little paddle boards with numbers on them like they used to do in the early days of fashion shows. They did this a number of times in a span of two hours. It turns out the city denied Hay a block party permit, but she’s always been a bit of a punk at heart.Hay opened her store in March of this year, and it’s obvious that it’s become a major creative driver for her. Her friend, the artist Tim Snell painted the floors of the store in an abstract animal-esque print in shades of tan and brown and blue that Hay said she wanted to turn into a fabric. She made good on that promise, opening the show with an easy knee-length belted dress with puffy sleeves, and a sports bra and flared yoga pant set—no really, made from spandex for actually working out!—both in that very same print. As for the rest, she was feeling a very “back to school vibe,” with lots of plaid flannel, denim separates, and kilts that joined the stable of core Batsheva dresses. A highlight of the collection was a trenchcoat with a kind of ruffle running down from the shoulders that Hay described as “very Madame Bovary-esque and work appropriate,” made in both denim and a dark mossy green twill. If passerby saw something they really liked, they could make note of the number then walk into the store and buy it. There are sure to be a lot of Batsheva shopping bags floating around the city today.“Usually for a show I am trying to find a place to build a world,” Hay explained outside her store among a throng of well-wishers. “Now I have a world, and I’m very close to this world, I spend a lot of hours in this world,” she said, referring to the store. “I didn’t need to create a world elsewhere. This show is about the people who support me in every way.” She combed through her Instagram to look at the people who had tagged her on their ’fit pics, and messaged them to see if they’d like to be in the show—a few of them even flew in from out of state.As the last model finished her walk, a man in his 40s or 50s riding a motorcycle pulled up. I overheard “I’ve lived in New York all my life,” and was unsure about where he’d be going with it. But he continued, “and as a born and bred New Yorker, this is exactly the kind of shit I live for. You’re just going about your day and then boom, you stumble onto something special like a fashion show. It’s so beautiful. Congratulations.” Then just as quickly, he sped away.', 'Looking at a collection by Svitlana Bevza is like that first breath of fresh air the morning after a rainstorm, a fitting reference for this season’s offering titled Dew in the Sun. And while Bevza was most certainly thinking about dew, she was also thinking about her home country of Ukraine. “The dewdrops in the morning look beautiful, but the title of this collection is also a phrase from our national anthem,” she explained. “It’s a very encouraging message—‘our enemies shall vanish like dew in the sun’—and we wanted to take that and conceptualize it into the pieces in the collection.”The Bevza we are very familiar with tends to stick to a more neutral color palette with little to no embellishments, but this season the designer added some subtle hints of sparkle and shine. A dewdrop-shaped strapless black taffeta gown was adorned with tiny crystal teardrops that, from afar, bore a resemblance to the drizzle left on leaves. A Bevza collection isn’t complete without a reference to wheat (a vital crop in Ukraine): Gold wheat-shaped ornaments accessorized the collection in the form of belt buckles, necklaces, and tie pins. Her signature black corset was ornamented with the motif alternating from shimmering gold to a murkier black, which Bevza emphasized was to showcase the history of Ukraine. “The intention with the mixed metal was to refer back to 2022. The bombs destroyed the fields of wheat, and that’s how the burned spikes looked,” she said.This season, the designer skipped a runway show for her twice-a-year showings in New York. Storytelling is always a big part of her process; she wanted the public to experience it themselves. “I try to find optimistic notes in what I’m doing. And Bevza’s storytelling keeps me in perfect shape, even in dark times,” she said. Starting tomorrow, regardless of whether you work in fashion, you’ll be able to visit the Ukrainian Institute of America to take a look and enter into this chapter of Bevza’s life.', 'Every season, Bibhu Mohapatra channels a specific muse for his collection, from Georgia O’Keefe to Françoise Hardy. For spring 2025, the designer set his sights on the writer, singer, and artist Patti Smith. But don’t expect an offering filled with Smith’s trademark style—there were no Breton shirts or field jackets here. Instead, Mohapatra’s collection incorporated colorful striped jacquards and beaded tulles, mini shift dresses and organza gowns—perhaps even the antithesis of what one would conjure when thinking of Patti Smith’s largely androgynous wardrobe. But Mohapatra never intended to reproduce the artist’s clothes in his offering. Instead, uses his muses as a lens to inform his approach rather than direct inspiration. “I didn’t want to do her style and her choices in clothing,” he said.During the early stages of moodboarding, Mohapatra returned to his native India with his parents’ and brother’s ashes to perform their final rites. “I went on a very spiritual pilgrimage,” he said. “That changed something in my head, as I’m sitting there in the middle of this conference of the universe.” When he returned, he became transfixed by Smith’s writing. “It really takes me to places where I can be—because I’m processing a lot of grief and a lot of so her poetry is also super heavy,” he said. “But you can also find optimism there.”That optimism shone through in Mohapatra’s ethereal bent, like the layered lattice point d’esprit dresses, flowing chiffon gown, and embroidered organza and tulle pieces. Going forward, he would benefit from leaning into that organic, bohemian sensibility, whereas some of the more structural pieces—particularly those rendered in faille—felt outdated.This season, Mohapatra is launching denim—a byproduct of opening a brick and mortar store post-lockdown. By connecting with his community in a physical space, he was able to field his customer’s needs. He also hopes it will be an opportunity to introduce younger clients to the brand. “Maybe her mother is our client for the dresses, and it allows her to enter into a more approachable price point,” he said. Perhaps, he postured, she’s a Patti Smith fan, too. “She’s youthful,” he said of his denim buyer. “She discovered Patti, and then she’s manifesting Patti.” But whether this will help expand the label to a younger clientele will reveal itself in due time. Smith said it best: “Who can know the heart of youth but youth itself?” She was talking about business acumen here, right?', 'An elegantly slashed-sleeve cashmere sweater (that allows you to wear it arms in or out) worn with a hem-sashed skirt. An organic cotton trench with an added scallop of (removable) ruffles. A valentine-red dress with a soft asymmetric fall. All these soft touches indicated that BITE Studios was in a romantic mood for spring. As such it felt a bit like a side step for the label.Founded on sustainable principles, the brand’s work-and-play friendly minimalism is responsible for their growing popularity in this less-is-more moment. The main tension at BITE Studio, its signature umami, if you will, has been created by adding feminine touches (a pinch of sugar) to simple and sophisticated silhouettes, about half of which are tailored. The beautiful, structured (often removable) petal pieces that have become a signature recently are a beautiful example of that. There were some present here, but the focus for spring was partly on more expressive ruffles, like the ones that cascaded down a long slip dress, or slithered along the side seam of pants or the hems of shorts for summer Saturdays. These felt saccharine in a way that the sash pieces or a softly draped jersey halterneck dress did not. The neatness of a shirred tank dress or a beetroot colored plissé tunic and pants, and the structure provided by slim wool trousers and a sharply cut blazer with one side overlapping the other, added a necessary “savory” element to BITE’s spring menu.', 'After some soul-searching in transition limbo, Blumarine has appointed a new creative director. Georgia-born designer David Koma will showcase his first collection for pre-fall; spring was crafted by the in-house team.Inspired by the fluidity of water and by Nick Knight’s dreamlike blurred images of rose blooms, the collection read as a more streamlined take on the brand’s signature girly look. The aquatic theme somehow washed away the saccharine, introducing a slightly boho tone that, while giving off a soupçon of Chloé, felt fresh and au courant. Ethereal fabrics billowed and flowed, rendered into voluminous see-through asymmetrical blouses with trailing scarves or into tiered hand-pleated minidresses; they’ll look their best promenading on the beach on a very windy day.To offset the overall liquid lightness, slim craquelé leather pants, laced all the way up, were introduced as a formfitting antidote to the diaphanous billows of chiffon and georgette. Fringes alluded to the flow of water, often interspersed with crystal drops and tiny metallic roses; swaying from the ultrashort hems of a translucent sequined minidress or pareo skirts, they replaced the fluffy trimmings of feathers and marabou. The color palette had a sun-bleached sheen, as if dried after a swim, while floral bouquets appliquéd on languid slip dresses hinted at shells gathered haphazardly from the shore. Even the signature leopard spots appeared in a tenuous, washed-out form, as if reimagined for a new breed of felines: the Blumarine aquatic leopard.', 'For spring, Emily Adams Bode Aujla continued to explore American athletic wear, which she began looking at last season with the launch of a secondary line, Bode Recreation, and a hugely successful collaboration with Nike. To start, she was thinking about a kind of “beach pajama,” inspired by the garments that people wore to the beach before swimsuits—which beginning in the 19th century included long tunics worn over trousers. Bode Aujla did a version in French striped cotton, but the idea of a simple tunic and pants runs throughout the collection in various fabrications and iterations, including embroidered silk chiffon tunics in boxy 1920s shapes, wispy tank tops worn with skirt/pant combos, and even a sequin-striped double-breasted mid-length jacket worn with matching trousers. Other nods to sports were present in her now-signature appliquéd Bode team jerseys and shorts, along with tennis skirts and retro-inspired bodysuits. Sailor shirts made from a heavy cotton featured darling illustrations, based on a vintage piece she acquired some years ago.\\xa0Elsewhere, the big news are her fabrics—cotton t-shirts in the finest, thinnest cotton you can possibly imagine, sporty terry cloth sets, knitted cotton tanks with the same hand feel as vintage wool, chunky cardigans made with a ribbon crafting technique, sumptuous studded suede jackets, and all manner of embroideries, bedazzling, and decoration. Though she’s long established an idiosyncratic point of view for her menswear, it’s most exciting to see the places where she takes her womenswear, which is not just the same Bode menswear styles cut for women, but its own thing. There are tiny cotton shorts with even tinier bikini tops for the young and daring, and funky Western-inspired shirts for the adventurous, along with wardrobe essentials like soft cashmere sweaters and lots and lots of denim. Almost a decade in, having established her codes, Bode Aujla is stretching the notions of what we can expect from her. There’s a Bode piece for every person, and for every occasion, and that is a good thing.\\xa0', 'A white mini dress, hand-stitched with ostrich feathers, was mounted on the wall at a preview of Bora Aksu’s spring collection. The designer said it was among a handful of garments he retrieved from his late mother’s estate, which he has slowly been cataloging in the wake of her unexpected passing earlier this year. “She always had impeccable style,” he said, combing through racks of polka dots and pearls in his showroom. “But she also refused to throw anything out.” Hundreds of cardboard boxes provided the requisite material for a heartfelt tribute, which Aksu this morning presented in the lush, sun-dappled gardens of St. Paul’s Church in Covent Garden. “She would have liked it there,” he said.The designer’s mother, Birsen, had been an ambient presence throughout much of Aksu’s work—she in fact crocheted a couple of pieces for his early collections, and the wonderful fussiness of her personal wardrobe can be mapped across each and every ruffle, bow embellishment, and Peter Pan collar he’s ever put into production—but this season he was more explicit in his homage. Knitted twin sets, boho skirts and jacquard sweater vests recalled the years she spent making her own clothes while practicing medicine in a remote Turkish town; pencil skirts and vintage lace blazers spoke to a woman determined to resist the role of housewife; and weightless silk tulle gowns in pale pinks and creams revealed the softer side of this loving matriarch.Aksu added that his mother was often happiest when pottering about the garden, and a series of prints were based on the dahlias in her own backyard, while floral appliqués were pressed between the delicate layers of silk chiffon dresses. “There comes a point when you’re expected to move on with life,” the designer said. “But I’ve experienced a more profound grief as time has progressed because the memories I once had are beginning to fade.” This season’s collection was an exercise in remembrance that included the Jubilee roses encircling St Paul’s. On a recce of the venue, Aksu told a groundskeeper that his mother used to whisper to her roses to encourage growth, and she promised not to shrub them until the show had wrapped. They were still in full bloom this morning.', 'Is Boss the best-cast show in fashion? It’s certainly ironic that a label known for defining the conventional corporate uniform in the past is, at present, absolutely avant-garde when it comes to unconventionally diverse casting. Even better, that diversity in size, color, and age isn’t performative or tokenistic. Instead, it’s the unintentional by-product of pure, cold marketing insight. An internal Boss strategy named Claim 5 has for several years determined that designer Marco Falcioni’s runways should contain a baseline mix of top-tier professional models alongside sportspeople, social stars, musicians, and a kaleidoscope of other eyeball-attracting cultural protagonists, all of whose criteria for inclusion has nothing to do with size and everything to do with reach and relatability.Today, following that brief, casting director Piergiorgio Del Moro delivered a pro-am crew that wandered through a springtime savannah set by Villa Eugenie. Falcioni has been mining and redefining Boss’s 1980s and ’90s corp-core heritage for a few seasons now. The spring collection was titled Out of Office and took its inspiration from elements that included a Peter Lindbergh fall 2003 Hugo by Hugo Boss image featuring a casually draped pant and looped belt in an otherwise all-formal tailored look and old shots of John F. Kennedy Jr. wearing full-look Boss with total insouciance. “I was asking myself how we adapt the look and feeling away from the idea of nine-to-five,” said Falcioni.His answer was to soften the tailoring (especially the shoulders), shift the color palette toward earthy browns and greens, crop tailored pants into roomy capris, and substitute brogues in favor of babouches. Men’s suits were cut sack-style, three-button single vent, but with those unstructured shoulders and in fabrics including raw silks, wool, and garment-dyed linen. Low-slung drawstrings were integrated into pants to create a sporty gather from quads to glutes. The casting story took in a quartet of professional menswear guys: George Cortina, Ben Cobb, Alex Badia, and Luke Day. These inveterate directional dressers all looked eminently believable in Falcioni’s gardening leave wardrobe.Womenswear saw Falcioni erode and soften the architecture of the double-breasted blazer into wrap-blazers, coats, and dresses. Blousons in wools and cottons were contoured by darting applied to affect freedom of movement rather than tailor the silhouette. Shawl collar tuxedo jackets were adapted into silk robes and robe jackets. That slimline sack suit shape was adapted and layered over cropped pants and shorts. Models toted soft briefcases and satchels that hung unzipped from their shoulders: out of them spilled ties, car keys, capped pens, and the occasional yoga mat.This was a collection that you could easily see WFH’ers being ordered back into the physical workplace freely signing up for. Falcioni this morning gently and therapeutically stretched Boss’s recent office-based identity toward a more balanced work-life wardrobe space, one that encompassed evenings, weekends, and days in nature.', 'Matthieu Blazy sure knows how to set a scene. The animal beanbag chairs—Michelle Yeoh on a ladybug, Kendall Jenner on a horse, Jacob Elordi, the new face of the brand, on a bunny—put the Bottega Veneta crowd in a buoyant mood tonight. It was like we were all kids again in a rec room, knees tucked under our chins, eager to watch our favorite show on TV.In his two and a half years at the label, Blazy has turned Bottega Veneta into the show of Milan Fashion Week. There’s the art- and design-world adjacencies—the arkful of leather beanbags were designed by Zanotta Sacco, and some of them will be available for sale on the company’s website tomorrow. And there’s the well-curated crowd—this season’s included the trans TikTok star Jools “Very Demure” Lebron and Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer and Olympian whose gender was questioned by the cyberbully Elon Musk: “Very cool move for them,” as my colleague texted from New York. But in the end, it’s Blazy’s clothes that put him in the league of designers that matter most. He’s the rare guy who can marry the conceptual with the coolly everyday.The concept this season was childhood. “I was interested in the idea of wow, the wonder you have as a kid when you try something—it’s almost like primal fashion, your first experience of fashion when you try your parents’ clothes,” he said. He showed too-big jackets and one-leg pants under asymmetrical wrap skirts, and pieces like a black tank dress and khaki and navy shirtdresses with built-in wrinkles like they’d been crushed at the bottom of a trunk waiting for a game of dress-up.The animal chairs were inspired by the movie E.T., Blazy explained, the scene where Elliott’s mom opens the closet and somehow misses the extraterrestrial hiding among all the stuffed toys. And that theme carried over to the clothes: frogs perching at the neckline of a dress and clinging to the heels of shoes, lapels in the shape of bunnies on leather coats, a scarf top printed with giant fish.If all that sounds unserious, it was, and that’s a risk for a label with deeply serious prices like Bottega’s. Blazy was making a bet that people will share his sense of humor and his heart. It was the right bet to make. In fashion now, especially here in Milan, we’ve seen a lot of playing it safe, of brands in rehash mode or standing in place. Blazy’s fashion, in contrast, looks free, whether he’s putting the accent on craft (did you get a load of the spiky leather wigs?), elevating essentials like Elliott from E.T.’s flannel shirt and denim (which were neither flannel nor denim, I don’t think), or embellishing a top and skirt with metal matchsticks, because why not?Then there were the simply, brilliantly chic things, like a vivid orange draped jersey dress and an icy white fringed three-quarter-length sleeve coat, and the unmissable bags, the most unusual being the one-of-a-kinds made with leather vests by students at Bottega Veneta’s school. Blazy’s enthusiasm is perceptible and catching. I think the reason we all left so jazzed is because it gave us back the feeling that propelled many of us into fashion as young people in the first place. Wow is right.', 'Pop-up shops for Free Assembly and Scoop NYC, the two labels that Brandon Maxwell designs for Walmart, will open for business this weekend in the Meatpacking District building where his show was held. Guests who didn’t have to scoot off to another event on this busy first official day of New York Fashion Week were invited to linger and discover the ways in which Maxwell has been elevating the box store’s fashion offering.At his eponymous brand, he’s rounding the corner on 10 years, and he’s in an exploratory phase, not quite trying on a new identity but stripping away the exuberance that once defined him in favor of a sexy kind of minimalism. The fluttery hem peeking from the bottom of the first look’s draped top, though the detail reappeared several times throughout the collection, was a bit of a feint. This was Maxwell at his most stripped back, layering body-conscious ribbed knits, using see-through neoprene for tailored pantsuits, and exposing midriffs above skirts.“I’ve softly unraveled the brand DNA to create garments that foster a sense of nonchalance,” he wrote in his show notes, calling it “a new proposition for our customer.” The thing is, the knit tank dresses that were peeled off the shoulders and worn as skirts were a shade too nonchalant; ditto the sheer skirts barely clinging to hips. A pink plunge-front dress lacked the precision of his usual work.Though his star rose on the event dresses he did for Lady Gaga, Maxwell has a knack for all-American sportswear. It has come in and out of focus over his decade in business. Here, it took the form of barn jackets with extra volume in the back and a touch of his native Texas twang that looked cool and confident. Backstage, Maxwell said he wanted to put them on every look; that’s not surprising, as they’re the kind of proposition a customer could really take seriously.', 'It’s a matter of equal opportunities. For nigh on 80 years, Brioni’s peerless Roman fatto a mano tailoring was only formally available to men. Then, last year, creative director Norbert Stumpfl cautiously began to sprinkle a few refigured feminine pieces into his mix, before showing Brioni’s first-ever stand-alone women’s collection last season.We started today’s tour in one corner of the new Brioni showroom that was filled with mannequins. It was easy to admire the floor-length, wide-leg pant shape Stumpfl freshly introduced and nod appreciatively as he described the methods used to create his double-faced cotton trench coats and soft-touch python bags. A wide-revere tuxedo embroidered with 8,000 knots, each tied with a tiny Swarovski crystal was highly impressive (and apparently sold out).It was in the next room, however, that Stumpfl’s most significant step forward in presenting his womenswear this season was revealed: real-life models. The luxuriant flow of the dense but intangibly light ivory silk in a floor-length shirtdress with inside-stitched patch pockets only became apparent as it was walked from one side of the room and back again. A strong-shouldered, nipped waist, long-skirted white double-breasted jacket worn over a prominently collared (only semi-tucked) blue shirt and those long wide trousers in a ripe tomato red looked like a lightning rod outfit for character amplification as it followed the same route. And a single-vented white coat version of that previously seen crystal-knotted tux—but here featuring 16,200 crystals applied over 40 hours of handwork—assumed its full room-stealing magnificence when humanly inhabited.After this press presentation wraps up tomorrow, it will stay open for Very Important Clients who are in town for the shows and keen to see more of Brioni. Stumpfl said they will be able to make made-to-measure orders, and that eventually he hopes that clients who are interested will be able to visit the Brioni workrooms in Penne to see their garments being made. There is another VIC event happening in two week’s time at Bergdorf Goodman. With clothes of this quality, there can be no substitute for seeing them with your own eyes, touching them with your own hand, and ideally enveloping your own being within them.', 'The grand tour was an early ancestor of today’s mass tourism. This 18th century-onward trend was a way for the monied classes in Europe’s chilly north to venture south to Italy and Greece to broaden their cultural horizons and get away from their parents. This season Brunello Cucinelli and his team flipped that template to make Italy not the destination but the starting point. These clothes charted a journey from Solomeo in Umbria—the epicenter of Cucinelli’s culture—and continued farther south.\\xa0In truth, of course, this journey was entirely imagined: Every apparent souvenir was handmade in Italy. What the story line allowed team Cucinelli to play with, however, were the contrasts between the classical structures of his tailoring and more conventional womenswear with the wilder, organically evolved output of his team of knitwear artisans. Exceptional bags and tops were fashioned in fluid sproutings of tobacco-toned macramé yarn in which were integrated metal-set chains of colored stone. There was a dress apparently made of macramé chain. Hand meshed knits were weblike and entirely irregular. These items were real trophies.\\xa0Against them were placed sleeveless safari jackets, panamas, clubbishly striped suiting, gauze cotton animalia skirts, cable knits, some cool Monili-tassled suede moccasins, and shirting with metal-embroidered linen cuffs. These pieces were all entirely lovable, but it was the experiments in knitwear—Cucinelli’s founding metier—that were most worth writing home about.', '“I think at Burberry there’s definitely a consciousness of what we put down the runway. We want it to feel like a dream, but we also want it to feel a real proposition for someone that wants to go there.” So said Daniel Lee this afternoon after his fourth runway show at British fashion’s tentpole house. Today Lee oversaw adjustments to both show format and collection emphasis that read as an implicit acknowledgement that Burberry needs to shift its pitch in order to right itself. Poor financial results (not to mention self-perpetuating, corrosive coverage of them) has also led to the recent introduction of New Yorker Joshua Schulman as CEO: today Burberry’s new white knight stood chivalrously at the door of the National Theatre to greet guests as they arrived.The NT was Lee’s venue of choice because its Brutalist architecture synced with the Lee-requested, scrubs-blue, cut-out canvas installation by veteran Young British Artist Gary Hume (formerly twice a collection collaborator with Stella McCartney). It was also, however, a pragmatically modest space compared with the three big check tents that preceded it. The slimmed down crowd still featured a swathe of British talents—including Skepta, Jodie Turner-Smith, Declan Rice, Damon Albarn and many more—who sat on wire-meshed chairs that left an appropriately check impression.We were presented with a collection that leant away from whimsy—no more duck hats, no more hot water bottles—in favor of a heightened focus on pragmatic merchandising. The storm flap, epaulettes, shoulder vent, Napoleon collar and belt of the house-archetype trench were intelligently applied across multiple garments including open-backed dresses, a popper-peppered twinset, and abbreviated, feather-collared jackets. The camel, red and black Burberry check was used most consistently as a detail on built-in belts, but also starred on a cropped duffel. In a series of men’s looks it was adapted into different varieties of check on attractive field jackets, half-zips and technical pants.Bengal stripe shirts were given an impactful but easy-to-achieve elan with the addition of a matching silver-clipped smocked scarf at the neck. Colored, washed leathers in Hume-ish matte pastels were crafted into fitted pants and cropped bikers. A washed floral ditsy print was used as an endearing substitute for camouflage on raincoats and tape-seamed combat pants. Low-rise front-seamed pants and shorts in denim or drill were given some sort of ruggedized protective treatment whose wash appealingly echoed that of the Hume canvas they were shown in front of. A tight formation of evening dresses in skeins of tinsel-toned sequins was on occasion framed by a tough leather parka.Lee pulled a crest from Burberry’s jostling archive to apply as a patch on an attractively silhouetted pale denim men’s look near the end. This was a collection that subtly positioned itself as a potential torchbearer for not one but two heydays in Burberry’s history; the century-ago period of its original emergence (with Lord Kitchener as brand ambassador) and its two-decade past emergence as Britain’s only high fashion superbrand. As Lee noted backstage, that more recent chapter was spearheaded by an American CEO and a British designer. The winds of change are rising at Burberry once again.', 'There was a feeling of everything coming together for Maja Dixdotter this season. The designer had an art-adjacent eccentric in mind when ideating the collection; in planning the visuals, she was interested in finding a way to do “more of a portrait instead of just a shoot.” Reenter Conie Vallese, the Milan-based Argentinian artist who modeled the brand’s pre-fall 2023 lineup and was again featured for this confident and grown-up collection. It was photographed at a location of Vallese’s choosing—an estate outside Florence that evoked the feeling of a Mediterranean getaway. Poolside options included a maillot paired with a black-and-cream striped crochet sweater and hat and tunic with inset bands of lace. A pearl-colored tunic with peekaboo insets of lace (a nice continuum with the material from pre-fall 2024) was a perfect cover-up. For town, there was a natty set, a long khaki vest with points at the front hem and A-line skirt, which provided a welcome borrowed from the boys element to a collection that tended toward the dressy. The deep, luxurious faux fur trim on a white V-neck night look, a caped caramel satin number, and printed silk evening pajamas had an alluring ’60s contessa kind of vibe that was on theme. More versatile and easier to pack for vacation were less decorative designs, such as a long, slim lilac knit dress with flower trim, a flowy printed caftan, and feathers trimming a midi-length dress, accessorized with heart thong sandals.Having made the decision to include at least one hand-crafted touch in every collection, this season Dixdotter worked with a collective in Madagascar who handmade the raffia bags using material they grew. The lace was also artisanal and made in India. The importance of supporting craftspeople and their skills cannot be stressed enough; it is wonderful to see this mission being carried out not only at the luxury level but by a brand that has relatively accessible price points—and a lot of eyes on it.', 'Last season was Derek Lam’s first as the creative director of Callas Milano. The brand had established itself as a purveyor of refined wardrobe staples—silk twill shirts, smart pants, a classic trench. Lam’s arrival brought a more polished formality to the fall offering. Notable additions included a jacket with New Look proportions through the waist and hips, and trousers with a corseted waistband. Spring sees him returning to Callas’s more laidback sensibilities. He said one of his focuses was on “weekend dressing.”Don’t mistake that for sweats and tracksuits. He was talking about Europeans’ approach to weekend dressing, not Americans’, but you will notice an easier sensibility to these looks. Be it a camp shirt and trousers in a dark rinse denim, or a blouson jacket and matching full midi-skirt in a technical yarn, everything is paired with flat shoes, to convey a relaxed state of mind. Sometimes the fabric does the talking. He washed a linen cotton vest and pants set, to create a “lived-in” feeling, and he added an elasticized band to the shoulder straps of a seersucker sundress to convey a similar up-for-anything attitude. Though the clothes are finely made, with attention to detail, they don’t come off as too precious.Details are important. He enlisted Valerie Barkowski, a Marrakech-based, Belgium-born textile designer to create the tassel embroideries you see on the collars of button-downs. As for the set, that’s the Villa Borsani, the modernist, mid-century home of the Italian architect and furniture manufacturer Osvaldo Borsani, which Lam calls the “spiritual home” of Callas. “It has a kind of chic that I really find inspiring.”', '“I never thought I’d listen to Bronco on the soundtrack of a fashion show in New York,” said my seatmate this morning at Patricio Campillo’s New York Fashion Week debut. But what a way to start day two of this marathon. The song was “Que No Quede Huella,” a hit by the Mexican “grupero” band Bronco, which played in the background of Campillo’s show. And just last night, that same seatmate and yours truly sang along to Juan Gabriel at the Willy Chavarria show.It was Chavarria, in fact, who inspired the Mexico-based Campillo, a 2024 LVMH Prize semi-finalist, to make the jump over to New York. Said Campillo: “There is a Latin community claiming its place in the industry here for what feels like the very first time. You have Luar [by Raul Lopez] and Willy, who have been breaking ground and making way for us for many years. That is what was in my mind when I decided to come here.”Campillo is a welcome addition to the NYFW fold. A self-taught menswear designer who started his career in fashion media and styling, his outlook is contemporary and forward-looking while embracing his cultural heritage, particularly that of “charro” culture, which broadly and historically refers to the ranchero, the trade horseman in the Mexican countryside. This has made the Campillo label a worthwhile representative of Mexican fashion, and its designer a notable voice as it pertains to next-gen Mexican artistry.This spring lineup was Campillo at his purest and most polished. The designer explained backstage that his seductive yet melancholic color palette of desert neutrals and dusky charcoals and oranges was an interpretation of his fascination with the volcanoes that run through Mexico, including Paricutín and Popocatépetl. “I thought of the serenity a dormant volcano can inspire versus the ferocity it displays once active,” said Campillo, explaining that it was in the push and pull between violence and peace, and how apropos this narrative feels globally and in Mexico, where he felt his collection found gravitas.What should be the takeaway from this morning’s show is that Campillo, who is close to 10 years in with his label, is not only ready for the wave of attention this inarguably larger platform will provide him, but that he is a remarkable tailor and a talented designer. (He makes all of his clothes in his atelier in Mexico, which he’s had for close to a decade.)', 'We’ve been talking about a changing of the guard at New York Fashion Week since we returned to in-person shows post-COVID. Carolina Herrera is the last brand you’d put in that league; Mrs. Herrera launched the brand 40 or so years ago in the go-go 1980s. But more and more, the label that Wes Gordon inherited from her in 2019 looks like a young woman’s brand, with a sexy freshness that most of the time doesn’t compromise the sense of circumstance long associated with the Herrera name.Take the series of stretch-jersey dresses near the end of the show. Midi length with a knotted neckline or long with a plunging V in pink, and in a floral halter style that had the look of swimwear, they’re comfort-forward and easy wearing in a way that’s new here. Or consider the boxy black “boyfriend” so oversize it almost obscured the white shorts underneath; the materials may be elevated, but at the foundation it’s as casual a look as can be. Pairing embroidered single-breasted, collarless jackets with capri pants gave even Gordon’s tailoring a playful, cheeky edge.All that said, the 28 Liberty Street venue, with its Noguchi sunken garden and, at street level, its Jean Dubuffet trees, suggested that Gordon hasn’t forgotten Herrera’s well-bred roots. He honored her codes, from the extravagant sleeve (see a black cotton one-sleeve dress) to polka dots (lots of them, including on a crocheted minidress and a compact knit bandeau top and tube skirt set), turning out clothes for all sorts of occasions, not just fancy parties. But don’t worry, he didn’t neglect the fancy frocks.With the ensconcement of the new guard, there are very few New York resources for a proper, scene-stealing ball gown anymore. Enter Gordon’s strapless black-on-white polka-dotted number, ruffles decorating its drop waist above a full, floor-sweeping skirt. “I was chasing the wow,” he said backstage. Great quote, even better dress.', \"Backstage before her show, Caroline Hu said she wanted to create a little more space to dream. Her retort to the headlines is to build a fantastical world.“Up until now, I had been trying to build up protective space around me,” she explained. By contrast, this season she considered within a very small space. “It’s like dancing in my bedroom,” she said. “I always have a lot of things going on in my mind, so I wanted to use a small space to create the craziest things.”“I want more peace to try and build up a safe space,” she added, describing her inspirations in dramatic terms of love and death, joy and shadow, connection and reflection.Sartorially, such musings made her want to freeze moments in time, for example when a breeze buoys the folds of a skirt. Achieving such volume demands a whole lot of invisible engineering—the designer was adjusting wired hems, ballooning skirts and bows up until the second before models set foot on the runway. The effect was poetic and virtually weightless.One idea carried over from past collections was a pillowed silhouette, here in deep rose red or saturated blue. “I think of those like a canvas,” Hu offered. “When I have a new inspiration, I put sketches on top of that canvas, and then I can judge whether it's the right feeling.” Blurred prints, extrapolated from photos taken from her apartment window on a rainy day added to the moody romanticism.Hu mixed the classics, such as taffeta, printed silk organza, hand knits and jersey, with performance fabrics treated to look like taffeta. Her tableau-like smocking—for example on a baby pink number—was produced thanks to an ongoing collaboration with the French lace maker Sophie Hallette. A handmade ceramic pendant top came by way of a new partnership with phone case and electronic accessories maker Casetify. Her spin on the Adidas SL72 and Superstar sneakers will be on sale in just a couple of months.To emphasize movement, Hu tapped dancers Emma Portner—whose recent work includes collaborations with Vogue, Apple, and Netflix—and Léo Handtschoewercker (who has modeled for several top houses) to perform an interpretive number. “I always try to find that moment, the one where light comes through the clouds,” said Hu.\", 'Before the Carven show began, there was the feeling of a lively weekend open house—only this fifth-floor apartment happened to have one of the most spectacular panoramic views of Paris, spanning the Grand Palais to the Eiffel Tower. Emptied out except for the runway seating and some abundant plants, every room had its timeworn charm: remnants of floral wallpaper, colorful tiling, and other decorative traces that suggested a lush lifestyle more than flat-out decadence.But whatever traces remain of the family that apparently owned this residence for decades, the space now belongs to Carven and its parent company, ICCF Group (founder of Icicle). While the team is normally spread out across the rooms, lucky them, the real significance is that the building marks the historic origin of the maison, where Madame Carven began designing in 1945. Today, the Carven store on the ground level carries Louise Trotter’s fall collection. Thus, slowly but surely, 6 Rond Point des Champs-Élysées stands not just as the House of Carven but its home.It’s worth reiterating that Trotter is wonderfully at home here. So much so that she carried the idea straight into the collection, which opened with a luxuriantly minimal dress in a shade of champagne and constructed to hover just slightly away from the body—an altogether different statement than the coat-topped looks at the start of her lineups until now. And it hardly mattered whether the pieces were swaddling or peeling back, sliced open or enhanced with swishing strips, long and unstructured or layered in a loose unraveling of ruffles—there was this constant sense of an intimate world taking shape in unexpected ways. All the shoes, from slippers to puffy mules, set a bedroom mood for introverts and extroverts alike.And there was space: space to move, of course, but also space to let a pearl necklace drape down the back, or for lace underpinnings to appear discreetly from the back of a waistband. Trotter understands that dressing women means understanding their relationship to their clothes; her silhouettes are considered yet never overworked. The intriguing ambiguity of a rounded trench (coat or dress?) on Marte Mei and the extended white tuxedo shirtdress topped with an ample collarless black jacket on Jessica Miller were both standouts. “A dress is a dress. It’s the woman who wears that dress,” Trotter insisted. “She makes them of her time.”Wherever the Carven woman is wearing these looks, for Trotter they represent “the quotidian, the rituals.” They have the potential to resonate with an interesting spectrum of clients, and the runway could reflect this more overtly. For as pleasing as it was to see Carven chez Carven, these clothes will make an even stronger impression when they’re out in the world.', '“When I was much younger I remember feeling that Mexicans in the US were a bit like us Arabs in Paris. We were both the outsiders, the underdogs who created our own culture, and our own way of dressing in clothes that are not super expensive but which have a really defined style. Now, 25 years after falling in love with that culture, this is my homage.” So said Charaf Tajer before this well attended Casablanca show this evening. More notable than the high-profile attendees who wore the brand top-to-toe—because business as usual—were the industry eminences who chose to be here for the first time: managerial changes inside this fledgling brand are bringing a cloutier crowd.They were greeted by a runway parked with four lowrider cars, emblems of that Mexican-American youth culture Tajer had related to from afar. However, as this collection started rolling out from backstage, it quickly became apparent that his starting point had evolved into a broader social portrait of what Tajer termed “LA subcultures.”We started with pinstripe blazer dresses and a leather-edged Chanel-esque set in mesh before a suit that didn’t have the waistline to look zoot: Tajer’s release said the tailoring was inspired by Pat Riley in his pomp. There was a luxury-amplified “homage” to Chicano tropes that featured a crystal-set hair net, satin work shirt worn open from the top, a bandana folded into the waistline of shorts, plus socks and slides. This and other looks veered shakily into the realm of gangster cosplay: possibly dangerous, and not in the manner intended.The house’s graphics team adapted the free-wheelin’, hard-tripping aesthetic of Californian psychedelic artists such as Rick Griffin into the seasonal house font and house-specialty foulard prints. There was a nice stoplight-on-windscreen gradient glare to the multicolor fades in crystal edged shirting. A vaguely Venice surf-inflected section betrayed the ocean between this collection’s conception and subject, applying candy tones to Dogtown codes: the oversized denim edged in rainbow frays was a strong look. Tajer said he’d been in touch with Bootsy Collins (who’d wanted to attend) and that look 49 was a specific tribute. This Casablanca homage felt sincere and contained some appealing garments, yet was sometimes apparently as underthought as the fate of a GTA bystander.', 'Cecilie Bahnsen has always embraced collaborations, reflecting the strong sense of community that has been central to her practice from the very beginning. Over several of her shows, she has worked with various artists and musicians, and this time she has expanded her references even further. She enlisted Japanese photographer and artist Takashi Homma to perform his tonal music live, while his photographs of the mountains around Tokyo were projected on the walls; more fashion-focused was a partnership with The North Face that produced a series of hybrids fusing sturdy outdoor backpacks and duffel bags with Bahnsen’s ethereal style.The mountaineering theme extended to the show’s casting, which featured three professional rock climbers: Bahnsen referred to their sport as “vertical ballet.” The athletic, outdoorsy spirit ran throughout the collection, crossbred with whimsy. The designer’s signature pouf and cloudlike silhouettes were adorned with functional details like drawstrings, technical buckles, and pullers, some in the form of flat-shaped flowers. These floral motifs, often with a sheer sheen, were appliquéd on fitted technical organza silhouettes or embroidered with a 3D fil coupé effect on bustiers, airy balloon skirts, and lightweight outerwear made from recycled nylon. Bahnsen cited the skeleton flower as her inspiration, a bloom that becomes transparent in the rain, revealing its skeletal structure—a fitting reference, as the relentless rain over Paris made us empathize with the shivery, wet state of those skeleton blossoms.', 'Earlier this month, Vogue Business featured CFCL designer Yusuke Takahashi as one of this year’s 100 Innovators and Sustainability Thought Leaders. Two years ago, the brand became the first apparel company in Japan to win B Corp status. Today at the Palais de Tokyo, the fashion world got a chance to lean in a little closer and see just what kind of new fashion era the designer is striving to materialize.Called Knit-ware Handbuilt, the collection explored the nexus of a state-of-the-art 3D computer knitting technique and the handiwork that has been passed down across cultures and generations all over the world for millennia. Backstage before the show, Takahashi offered that he also had been delving into the writings of French social anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, who posited that the mind—more than the environment—dictates culture.“I’m very conscious about making something with my hands before thinking [about it],” the designer said, citing pottery, hand-dyeing techniques, and the clothes he observed on backpacking treks through India, the Silk Road countries, and Southeast Asia as inspiration. But while he likes zeroing in on traditional craft, Takahashi said he is also intent on keeping CFCL, an acronym of Clothes for Contemporary Life, “free from definition.”The show was set to a live performance by the Slovenian experimental folk-acoustic band Sirom, which, fittingly, crafts its instruments as well. Against that backdrop, Takahashi sent out his own experiments: An exploration in flatness, inspired by shapes spotted in Eastern Europe and Africa, yielded seamless tops that hugged the torso as if vacuum packed, with wide edges skimming from shoulder to waist (an Yves Klein Blue dress looked particularly flattering). Traditional ikat and chusen dyeing techniques were revisited in a recycled polyester knit called “knikat” and silk, respectively, both in psychedelic hues.But it was the handiwork that carried the day. Crocheted patchwork—an exercise in machine-less, 100% human-generated freeform—looked like editorial catnip, from a rosette-covered bralette to organic-inspired peekaboo numbers. A sleeveless black dress with a fringed skirt (some 2,320 shimmying tabs hand-threaded in tiers) was produced on mono material without a single stitch or seam. That, plus it’s machine washable (lose a fringe, just rethread it yourself). Not only did it look glamorous, it seemed like it would actually align with life out there in the real world.', 'Chanel was back at the Grand Palais for the first time in four years. The sun poured in through its freshly renovated glass roof and gave the embroidered tweeds of the many clients in attendance added sparkle. They were in their happy place, taking selfies and complimenting one another’s looks, apparently unbothered by the empty creative director’s seat that has been the subject of so much speculation among industry insiders since the shows began a month ago in New York.Front row discussions have focused on not just who should get the job, but what kind of talent they should be: A marketing genius? A creative guru? And wouldn’t it feel right and true if it were a woman? Everyone has an opinion, including Hedi Slimane, who dropped a surprise Celine collection online over the weekend with distinctive Coco leanings.For spring, Chanel’s creative studio took the Grand Palais itself as a starting point. The show’s most remarkable pieces were hand-knit in the pattern of its soaring Art Deco iron and steel work. Lightness, airiness, and a whisper of ephemerality were the directives for the collection, which the studio team achieved in various ways: skirts with front slits that proffered glimpses of leg, collars made from layers of downy feathers, trailing chiffon capes, and platform shoes that added a feeling of youthfulness to the proceedings.An enormous birdcage stood at the center of the Palais, a callback to a Jean-Paul Goude–directed, Vanessa Paradis–starring Chanel commercial circa 1991. The models crisscrossed the cage as they made their way back and forth around the nave, and the vast distances they walked were a visual reminder of the house’s long history. The creative team had ideas about how to keep its proprietary tweeds looking fresh: by using candy pastels or swapping the famous skirt suit for a shorts suit. There were surprises, too, like a black denim jacket and jeans, both embellished with shiny black sequins, which caught the casual way that the young women working at the “accessorization” in the atelier a couple of days before the show make Chanel every day and their own.The evening looks were created in a similarly playful spirit, mixing embellished denim and a feather-dusted baby blue cape, and adding a chiffon train to a sparkly tweed jumpsuit. Riley Keough wore something along those lines when she sang Prince’s “When Doves Cry” perched from a swing inside the birdcage at the finale. The dove is paused mid-flight, and the whole industry is watching to see which way it takes off again.', \"Since graduating from Central Saint Martins in 2022, Charlie Constantinou has built a cultish reputation as a purveyor of gleefully expressive gorpcore.“My work is very much based around adaptability and how you can transition between different environments,” he said after today’s show, “but when you look at a lot of technical wear and outwear brands, it's always very much limited [in terms of] silhouette. I've always loved technicality, but I’m always trying to be more imaginative in thinking about what that could look like.”For Charlie, the answer lies in abiding by the familiar doctrines of technical wear—deadstock ripstop nylons with contrast zip details abounded for spring, lending themselves to parachute pants, tactical vests and the pleats of miniskirts. What made them stand out was less the cut of the pieces—which, it should be noted, was certainly competent, but the evocative hues in which each one was hand-dyed.Exhibiting the flair of a master colorist, each piece was dappled in the ombré hues of a scorched desert landscape: cotton drill kilts that gradated from lemon yellow to dark, humus brown; grey jersey tops swaddled in tight, cape-like drapes, printed with flame orange swirls; puckered deadstock nylon backpacks and cotton Bermuda shorts in stony marbled washes.Preexisting fans of the brand will no doubt be glad to see Constantinou developing his approach to bringing natural color textures to the synthetics-heavy world of techwear, but the most interesting developments came by way of the designer’s most comprehensive womenswear offering to date, anchored in an impressive knitwear offering. Fitted vests and column skirts came in cotton bouclés etched with craggy graphics—they were, in fact, mesh panels integrated into the pieces. Naturally, there was a technical consideration at hand, with the construction bringing breathability to pieces, allowing them to be worn in the searing climates Constantinou drew inspiration from. Very cool knitwear, if you will.\", 'Mother knows best! Well, when it comes to dressing, Chet Lo’s certainly does. That much was clear from the designer’s heartfelt homage to his own, Mai-Wah Cheung, a formidable pioneer in New York City’s computer sciences industry. “In the 1990s, she was actually one of the first women in the city to study in the field,” Lo said proudly while backstage at a preview. “She then took the world by storm, going on to become the CIO of multiple companies,” including mass-media titan Univision.Climbing that sort of a career ladder takes composure, conviction, and grit—qualities, Lo noted, he’s glad to have inherited from her—not to mention a wardrobe that communicates at first glance. Meeting Ms. Cheung today, however, that isn’t the impression you’d necessarily glean: “She’s now done a complete 180 and really discovered her delicate side,” said her son. “She works as a schoolteacher and a painter—it’s such an inspiring change.”Accordingly, Lo’s collection contemplated this transition, articulating the delicate nuances of her character in cloth. Obvious 9-to-5 codes figured, but more compelling were the interpretations of her go-to cobalt plaids on gauzy shift dresses and a strapless column silhouette that translated the check in the designer’s signature durian knit. There was also clear evidence of Lo pushing the technique into more mature territory, most notably with a slick charcoal boatneck gown and as subtle panels running along the sleeves of a fitted wool shirt.Mai-Wah Cheung’s turn from corporate life was sweetly acknowledged by a pair of tank dresses that gently jingled with glass beads in the shapes of the fruit bowl medleys that inspire her painting practice. And the show’s opening look—a gossamer white gown bisected into sections in crisp gauze and an origami pleated rendition of Lo’s puckering—connoted the vulnerability that she’s come to perceive as a strength.Though Lo’s celebration of his mother’s emotional transition was born of homage, it also, in a sense, mirrored a transformation of the designer’s own. “I’m really tired of just creating these punky, crazy, club-kid clothes,” he said, “so this was me trying to elevate the brand and say something that’s really elegant—demure, even.” Granted, fans of the clubbier gear Lo has made a name with will find their appetites satiated by the body-cladding cropped polos and teensy bandeau skirts in glitched-out graphics—not delivering on this front would be a silly move, commercially speaking. Signs of refinement were most apparent in notable developments with the wovens. Though there’s still room for refinement, a gray minidress with a jaunty cowl hood gestured toward territory that it would be great to see Lo pursue further. Its source of inspiration was, naturally, an image of the designer’s mother, a pinnacle of chic swaddled in a scarf.', 'Few designer appointments of recent times have gone off with the bang that Chemena Kamali’s at Chloé has. Partly it’s her credentials: She worked at the label twice before landing the top job last year, and she’s German like Karl Lagerfeld, who himself had multiple stints at the French house and set its tone and aesthetic with a string of influential late ’70s collections.But it takes more than the kismet of shared biographies to resonate the way Chloé is today. What it really boils down to is Kamali’s feeling for it, and that in itself is a mysterious brew of intuition, hard work, guts, and, yes, even luck. Which is how you might describe the fortuitousness of Vice President Kamala Harris choosing her designs not once but twice at the Democratic National Convention last month, one in a shade called coconut brown—purely coincidence, the brand insisted at the time—that was tailor-made for all the meme generators on the campaign trail making content about Harris’s viral coconut-tree remarks.The media glare could’ve added to the pressure of putting on a second show. Sophomore collections can be more challenging than the first, especially when the debut has been a success but the shock of the new has started to wear off. Kamali demonstrated not a stitch of self-doubt with the clothes and accessories she showed today; at a preview she said, “It was a fun season. We had a good energy, because you felt how the first show was resonating and it gives you a lot of happiness. You then just want to give everyone more, you know? And we’re exploring other ideas, other sides of Chloé.”The collection was a confident evolution of her first outing, with more casual elements—like high-waist, flared jeans recalling Phoebe Philo’s for the brand circa spring 2004 and a pink flamingo bathing suit channeling the cheekiness of the Stella McCartney era—that may be easier access points for the brand than the ruffles and laces worn by the celebrities and models in the front row today. On that note, the little kitten-heel jelly sandals will also be a popular hit.Like Kamali’s first, this collection was built on her intimate understanding of Chloé’s history. Photos of Lagerfeld-designed collections were pinned to the mood board in her studio. Two of her most inspired lifts were the waist shapers of spring ’77 and the lace bloomers of spring ’78. Both have the potential to reshape how young women think about sexy dressing in 2025. Jackets—in sturdy workwear cotton, soft suede, and leather and all built with generous gathers along their strong shoulder lines—gave the sensual lightness of these pieces some ballast, maybe just a shade too much.Freshness and lightness are what make Chloé what it is, and Kamali has an assured hand with both. The floral-bouquet-print dresses in cascades of ruffled chiffon, shorter in front and longer in back, caught the air beautifully as they made their way down the runway. Chloé’s It girls and perhaps even other women, less prone to flowers and frills, are counting the days until next summer. They look like a dream to wear.', 'There is nothing in the wide world of fashion like the stomp and the swirl of the Chopova Lowena sisterhood in action. Back in London, in the crumbling underground basement of old Shoreditch Town Hall, the packed scene was one of the collective conventions of fans and friends that only these two can raise.The women of the Victorian Wild West were the inspiration behind this gathering in the wild east of London. Emma Chopova spent a slice of her formative years in the States. “We’re looking at America because of, I guess, my American upbringing, but it’s a weird take, where it’s about female folk heroines of the American West, like Annie Oakley and Calamity Jane. And the woman who brought cancan to America.” This was in a preshow Zoom conversation. Laura Lowena—who very recently gave birth to twins—added, “We also looked at, like, rhythmic gymnastics. A lot of different Olympics, where they did all different kinds of gymnastics. The Bulgarian Olympic team and the British Olympic team, through the ages, a lot the ’80s and ’90s were most inspiring—all the prints and all the sequins. There was a lot of information to look at.”Originally—back in the day when Chopova and Lowena collaborated on their Central Saint Martins MA graduate collection—it was the unlikely combustion of Lowena’s enthusiasm for outdoor sports and Chopova’s love of Bulgarian folk costume that fused into the long-lasting genius of their knife-pleated, rock-climbing, carabiner-suspended skirts. That incredibly distinctive garment is as popular a brand signifier to an indie generation of all genders, sexualities, shapes, and sizes as a Chanel jacket is to mainstream fashion. Its endless iterations in different collaged colors, tartans, and patterns are worn as a sign of belonging that’s largely responsible for spreading happiness among Chopova Lowena’s audience as they crowd into their seats.But, of course, their original recipe—something folksy with something sporty—has gone far beyond that now. It’s fully head to toe, layered up in tiers and smock-y Victoriana blouses over petticoat skirts over pants over jumbles of elaborate socks and studded boots. Then there’s their talent for unmissable jewelry and hardware—and often an anarchic combination of both. This time that included cutlery in the hair, horse braces, and necklaces festooned with toy horses.And even more double-take-y than that: the Chopova Lowena collaboration with Asics trainers, surreally tricked out with metal butterflies so huge that they almost looked like mythical beasts. “They’re actually garden-center ornaments,” Chopova noted.Among the fast paced, pell-mell energy of this show, there was a lot more going on, including a “mommy” bag with a spoon, Band-Aids, a rattle, a toy car, and an emergency jar of Hellman’s mayonnaise strapped to the outside. Yet more was—literally—in the air: the scent of roses, or was that geraniums? Both, actually. Chopova’s father, she related, has “found this really cool factory in the Bulgarian Rose Valley. We’ve made perfumes with Bulgarian flowers and herbs in them, all based in rose oil.”The designers revealed that they’d pitched this idea for developing fragrances and candles to the BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund as their business-extension plan should they win. And, of course, they did.', 'A murder took place on the East River in New York tonight—a fictional fashion murder, that is. For Christian Cowan’s spring collection, the designer brought his guests out to a midtown riverside show venue, and then placed them right in the middle of a spooky murder mystery. The story was that all of Cowan’s runway models were fleeing a glamorous party where—dun, dun, dun—someone had just been poisoned. Whodunnit? And who was next? Some models ran for their lives down the catwalk in their sky-high stilettos; others sauntered fiercely, while holding a flashlight and looking around bewildered. Call them all Cowan’s final girls. “I’m a cinephile, and I love a good murder-mystery thriller,” said the designer.While the theatrics of it all were centered around escaping a psycho killer, the clothes were less horrifying—more built to party the night away in. Cowan is known for his splashy evening wear, after all, most typically built on loads of crystals and feathers—but this season he said he challenged himself with doing cocktail attire in a less ostentatious way. “I don’t ever want to get stagnant,” he noted. That resulted in a mostly-black palette of shiny satins and leathers, with the occasional splash of sparkle and blues. (Cowan can never resist a bit of sparkle.)His opening look, a white satin bra top with lace trim, and a shredded bubble skirt, suggested the model nearly escaped a knife-wielding killer. The sea of black dresses that ensued certainly weren’t classic or timeless: some were totally sheer and floor-length with a train attached to the hand, others were in shiny leather and super strappy across the chest and abs, dominatrix-style. Cowan managed to make even the most saucy (if not slightly trashy) silhouettes feel subdued, a tricky balance to get right. There were clear attempts at upping the taste level here, though a few of the heavily logo-branded pieces felt unnecessary, and the star-shaped chest cutouts tricky to wear.But it was the satin suits and tailoring that really felt fresh. They marked a more grown up, sophisticated side of Cowan. Some of his sharp blazers were punctuated with a closure of a real rose dipped in sterling silver; it’s a fabrication he debuted at this year’s Met Gala, when he wore matching suits with Sam Smith. Cowan also had to make one blazer in a silver shimmer fabric, of course—a nod to sparkly flapper style, which is popularly referenced in murder-mystery parties. “I wanted to bring people to an imaginary time period that doesn’t really exist,” he said. “It’s an amalgamation of the 1920s and 1940s, with some modern elements thrown in.” Sure, the show was macabre-themed, but his streamlined designs showed real promise.', 'The Italian artist and competitive archer Sagg Napoli shot arrows at a target as the models did their circuit at Christian Dior today. Glass partitions separated her from the audience for safety, but they didn’t lessen the fierceness of her performance. Napoli, whose real name is Sofia Ginevra Gianni, wore a one-shoulder bodysuit and car wash miniskirt from Maria Grazia Chiuri’s new collection and her muscles contracted and released with each release of her bow. There’s never been anything like her on a Paris runway before.Since her arrival at Dior in 2016, Chiuri has referenced a long list of strong women, but Napoli is the first whose power manifested in such a physical way. She was a sort of contemporary avatar for the women warriors of ancient mythology that Chiuri said she took as muses this season. From Diana the Huntress to Wonder Woman to Napoli—that’s the through line.Representations of all of them were pinned to Chiuri’s mood board in the Dior studio, along with an autumn 1951 look, with suggestions of formal riding attire, that Christian Dior dubbed the Amazone. Chiuri was making links between ancient Greece’s peplos, a simple draped garment she’s often referenced, and the house founder’s rigorous tailoring. The connective tissue was the slicing diagonal lines suggestive of movement and agility, qualities that have not often been connected with the idea of womanhood and femininity.In some ways, this was a return to Chiuri’s debut for spring 2017, which used the language of sport to convey its sense of freedom and set the groundwork for her feminist project. Here, archery replaced fencing, but the athleticism of the clothes seemed mostly influenced by the street and the way modern women wear their exercise gear out of the gym and in the other parts of their lives, in part because nothing else is as comfortable. Here, bodysuits were styled under semi-transparent dresses, blazers were paired with mesh track pants, and jackets were crisscrossed with parachute straps. For shoes, many of the models wore knee-high gladiator boots.Accenting the collection’s more traditional ready-to-wear was a circa 1970-’71 graphic Dior logo. With its exaggerated vertical lines, somehow evocative of a movie title sequence, it conveyed aerodynamism and speed. The same goes for the jackets and shirts that were cut to fall off of one shoulder, with the added element of sexual allure. Some of these shoulder-exposing jackets and shirts were accessorized with gauntlet gloves that inched past the elbows to almost the shoulders, a look lifted—believe it or not—from a 1949 Dior show.“Myths tell us you have to renounce your femininity to be strong and to be right,” Chiuri said at a preview, “but Sagg says no, you don’t have to renounce your femininity to be strong.” Chiuri’s collection successfully inverted that idea: You don’t have to renounce your strength to be feminine.', 'In a grand ballroom inside the ritzy Pierre Hotel in New York City, designer Christian Siriano transformed the space by erecting a giant weeping willow tree (fake, of course) smack-dab in the middle of it. Suddenly, the room—filled with black tie-clad showgoers like Selma Blair, Cyndi Lauper, and Lil’ Kim—felt just a little less stuffy, and a little more fantasy-like. “I really wanted this dark, Grimms’ Fairy Tales feeling,” said Siriano. “It’s a bit of a fairyland—but a dark fairyland.” Naturally, the designer—known for his theatrical tulle gowns and voluminous silhouettes—had the clothes to match. This season Siriano riffed on his signatures (tulle, lots and lots of sequins, and more tulle), but aimed to give them more of a twisted-romantic feel.Candidly, the designer said that the more macabre sensibility this season reflected his inner workings when crafting the collection: While grappling with uncertain changes to his business, he said, “I was feeling all that [darkness]—but I was also in an evening, glamour mood.” Hence he decided to fuse the eerie with the elegant. The first look was a black, off-the-shoulder leather dress with beaded cutouts that were meant to mimic the pattern found on tree bark. “You feel like this amazing nymph thing in it,” said Siriano. The first 17 looks continued on with the black focus—a downer of a shade for a designer who does fun and levity so well. Black soon transitioned to white, though, where Siriano did his take on a fairy bride. There were asymmetrical tuxedo jackets, and strapless corset gowns with a built-in draped skirt.While the assortment was largely devoid of color, there were attempts to make it not so much of a snoozefest, like the “tattooed” black lace work on tops, pants, and gowns. “When you wear it, it looks like it’s tattooed onto your skin,” said Siriano. Plus, as one of the few New York designers who continues to make size diversity a real noticeable focus on the runway, it’s hard to criticize him for having too many black looks, when they do come in all silhouettes and sizes.Siriano’s more colorful, eye-popping designs shined brighter—a happy ending to his fairytale. He experimented with pink tulle frocks with widened shoulders and an even wider skirt; and a floor-length tulle gown with bell sleeves and a long, sweeping train—in a dégradé shade of blues and purples.“It was all about creating texture, and different shapes and silhouettes,” he said. Florals, given the fantasy theme, also appeared—though very literally, on the sleeves of ball gowns, and shaped as a giant lily across the chest.Embroidered metallics applied onto sheer mesh netting worked well on the knee-length cocktail dresses—sure to be a red carpet hit with Siriano’s A-list clientele—but after the 10th iteration, it began to feel like a storybook that would never end. The collection could have used an edit. But the ending was well worth it: Jessica Stam and Coco Rocha emerged as Siriano’s silver fairies—Rocha in a sculptural gown with an exaggerated neckline and built-in hood, and Stam in one of his silver appliquéd gowns. When in doubt, call in some supers to end with a bang.', 'Christian Wijnants is in reset mode. After a two-year break—during which a sideline made him a collateral victim in a drama of money and murder known informally as the \"Belgian Versace” scandal, followed by a retreat to Sri Lanka and a newfound dedication to yoga. He returned with a spring collection rooted in serenity. It was set to a soundtrack any yoga devotee would appreciate.In gilded salons overlooking the Arc de Triomphe, Wijnants described this outing as a “peaceful, personal experience.” A collection intended to enhance serenity and repose was defined by soft tailoring, forgiving shapes, flowing scarves and an overarching sense of ease.“Cliché as it sounds, I wanted to go back to how everything was slower during the pandemic,” he offered, adding, “I wanted to reconnect with a serenity in my life that I had not experienced in a long, long time.”The “less is more” mantra inspired the designer to rein in his hallmark hot color and prints in favor of organic textures like raffia —winningly on a deep-V dress or sleeveless top—topstitched stripes or organza printed and layered to create “perfectly imperfect” checked motifs. There was a newfound emphasis on shoulders, for example in white linen safari jackets, corsetry, summer knits or shirting constructed to sit back from the nape, just so. Sleeveless bombers were cut in Japanese cotton-coated organdy. Prints, though impressionistic, remained understated, in shades of gray punched up with dabs of copper, green or royal blue. The designer drew on the work of textile artist Mrinalini Mukherjee, whose work with cords was reiterated in pieces worked in organic crochet and macramé.In the front row were several clients dressed in the rich colors, prints and textile treatments that Wijnants has focused on for 22 years now. This collection may have been restrained by comparison, and while not everything connected, it was good to see him back in the game.', 'Light, free and unfettered: That’s how Christopher Esber is thinking about next spring. It’s how he’s seeing the clothes—there was so much here that was diaphanous, floating around and away from the body, yet still rooted in the reality of what a woman might want (and actually be able) to wear. Yet it also drove his creative process when he was working on it; that was just as unencumbered.Standing backstage moments before the show, and exuding a preternatural calm that I only wish I could muster up for this Fashion Week (or for this lifetime, for that matter), Esber, who’s Sydney-based, and won the ANDAM prize this year, spoke about how he let his mind go wherever it wanted. “I was thinking about different fragments of different decades, whether it’s polka dots from the 1980s, or turn of the century underwear, or ’50s pin ups,” he said. “There is a very defined silhouette for the Esber woman, but I’ve definitely tried to evolve it this season.”When he was talking about a defined silhouette, what he meant is what he calls “relaxed glamour.” In Esber-speak that means a look that’s pared back, minimalistic, and a tad—and this is meant in a good way—severe. It’s not like he has let that go. Take a look, for instance, at the way he interplayed draping into the strict lines of his black or stone suiting, or the gray pants which looked as though the waistband had been dipped in tar to give them a little hard-edged gloss. (It’s actually resin and has  become a thing of his.)As for that sampling across the decades Esber was talking about, you could see it in the prettiest pintucked and lace-trimmed long shorts cut from a delicate silk, or the way his dots formed an animated matrix on a killer draped dress with a high neckline, skinny sleeves, and a skirt that sinuously snaked to the floor. Esber brought a touch of the ’70s fused with the ’90s too, in the shape of two very good billowing anoraks with double pleating framing the shoulders and the body of the jackets. One had what he called, laughing, “an ugly Hawaiian shirt print.” Truth be told, it wasn’t ugly at all. What its use did indicate, though, was that Esber is letting his mind fly, seeing that what at first look like dissonant elements can be brought together, and then seeing where they land.', 'It has been a hectic summer for Co’s Stephanie Danan. In between finalizing the spring 2025 collection, she’s also been in the throes of planning a move to a new apartment which will mark her as “officially officially” living in Paris. “I’m getting the keys on October 1st and it’ll be the second to last day of market,” she explained over Zoom from her showroom. “Basically, I have to pack all the boxes at night, and I have a child, so there’s also all this school stuff…” It’s a scene that will be familiar to many a working woman—when it rains it pours! It’s not surprising then, that the lookbook opens on an image of a woman wearing a white cotton shirt with a cowl neck and a wrinkly cotton maxi skirt, topped off with a cotton canvas workwear jacket, and sturdy flat leather sandals. On one arm an oversized leather tote bag, on the other, an oversized leather clutch. “It’s so funny to look at it that way, but it’s a reflection of exactly what I’ve been through and what I’ve needed to wear,” she added when I pointed out it seemed like a case of art reflecting life.The personal anecdote wasn’t needed as proof that in recent seasons Danan has zeroed in on making clothes for women living very real, very full lives—all one needs to do is look at her lineup, which this season was dominated by utilitarian silhouettes in classic washed cotton canvas. But instead of just rehashing the same old shapes, Danan is fusing them with elegance and maybe even a sense of occasion. Like the long washed canvas coat with big patch pockets at the chest, with a very long cape-like back which can be draped dramatically across the body in the same manner as an evening coat. It is also outfitted with straps on the inside so that it can be carried like a backpack, something that serves both a practical purpose (it’s too hot for this coat!), and an aesthetic one (now I’m wearing an extravagant cape!). The designer also cut these same utilitarian pieces out of silk with a satin finish and in a semi-sheer cotton that had the appearance of a technical nylon, which imbued the collection with a bohemian explorer vibe in the case of the former, and a Y2k experimental energy with the latter.“What I’ve realized is that I’d been sort of fighting my two cultures a lot, where I feel like occasionally I am a chic Parisian person, and then other times I am more of a practical American sportswear kind of person, because I have grown up in both cultures and I sort of have a love-hate relationship with both,” Danan said. “And in the last couple of seasons I’ve been like, ‘No, this is who I am,’ that the collections are a combination of the more feminine side and the need for utilitarian practical clothes that can keep up with you in the crazy life that we lead… that’s what makes it cool.”', 'Stuart Vevers used everyday denim, leather, khakis, and cotton T-shirting for his spring 2025 Coach collection. Yet even when he was using these raw materials—and, sometimes, they were literally raw, thanks to the clothes’ frayed edges and tattered seams; other looks were delightfully creased and crumpled—they were a reminder that Vevers has the Midas touch right now. I mean, come on, did you see those last-quarter results for Coach?! The brand is on an up-and-up-and-upward trajectory, which is all the more impressive given that we’re in a moment of hand-wringing about stalling sales and tanking interest in fashion. Yet leading with this financial factoid feels a bit off, a tad crass, for the simple fact that the reason his Coach is connecting is because Vevers has put his creative faith in the future: in youth, in sustainability, in the idea that an honesty about authenticity and heritage go hand in hand with a certain joyfulness, playfulness, and—this might be the first time I’ve written this in a review—friendliness.That’s the approach and here’s how it all played out courtesy of Vevers’s newest offerings. Like other designers these past few days, he’s been looking at classic American archetypes, the things that have loomed large in the national—and global—psyche. He has been breaking them down and reconstructing them, testing their strength and durability. As he put it at a collection preview some days ago: “I’m really very intrigued by how the new generation is discovering those American classics and seeing them through fresh eyes.” So the preppiest of looks opened his show, a navy blazer and khakis with an “I Heart NY” tee. The relative classicism of Vevers’s tailoring was in sharp and cool contrast to the upcycled, patched-together sloucherama beige cotton pants; the look was weathered, worn, and wonderful. (And as with many of the looks here, it turned up on a girl and then a boy, but the mindset at work is definitely fashion first, gender second.)Likewise, aviator and Perfecto leather got a second life from being reworked into roomy multi-buttoned cardigan jackets or teeny-tiny biker jackets. At that preview, Vevers mentioned that the best way to reuse things is to take them and then chop them up with merry abandon, so that by using the smaller and best parts of whatever you’re upcycling, you let the pieces have a meaningful reinvigoration. Let the imperfection become an age-patinated perfection of sorts, as it were. Also, he noted that the amount of seams that are needed has “become part of our design language, which is interesting; piecing things together has helped us create new silhouettes.” Elsewhere, he rode the wave of the ’60s with zingy satin minidresses—“I love the colors, I love the optimism they bring”— as if uptown debutantes had had one too many acid freak-outs and decided to fuck them up, giving up a life of the Carlyle for the Velvet Underground’s “Exploding Plastic Inevitable” in the process. (I mean: Who wouldn’t?!)Of course, Vevers wouldn’t be Vevers if he wasn’t also giving sly winks. Yep! Bring on the bags! Bigger-than-big clasp-frame clutch purses in vegetable-dyed leathers, based on a 1969 Bonnie Cashin design, as well as other clutches in the shape of cartoonishly large lips, hearts, and bones. Smaller shoulder purses jangled with teddy bear and heart charms; cassette tape and toy car novelties were atop scuffed-to-hell white sneakers. Many of the accessories had also been scrawled on with pen graffiti the way you did when you were in fifth grade. (Well, maybe you did: I was way too much of a goody-two-shoes.) All of this was a salient reminder that Coach might be a big, international corporate brand, but there’s no cynicism at work here. You can feel it, sense it, and—best of all—you can wear it and carry it.', 'Every now and then, it feels as if “the industry”—that invisible hand we often blame things on when they don’t work and seldom mention when they do—comes together to stand behind a new designer. There are profiles written and meetings taken, emails exchanged and front-row chatter: “Have you heard of…?” “You have to go see…”Since her low-key but much lauded debut last season, that designer is Colleen Allen. She is a Chicago native who cut her teeth working on menswear at The Row, following an internship at Calvin Klein under Raf Simons and studies at the Parsons School of Design in New York and London’s Central Saint Martins. Allen’s first collection, which was presented in February by appointment only, garnered substantial press and was bought by Ssense and a number of select boutiques. But despite the powers that are now seemingly fanning her fire, Allen is taking things slow.She returned to Fashion Week this season, once again showing her collection by appointment. This understated presentation style suits her clothing. Minimal and austere, Allen finds inspiration first in her fabrics, which consist primarily of natural textiles, and secondly in her growing collection of Victorian garments, mostly underpinnings.This lineup was a carefully curated mélange of both. Allen utilizes bright colors with an idiosyncratic touch, prioritizing depth over saturation or color-blocking. Here, she employed cotton velvet—as opposed to silk, which has too much of a shine for her—to create whimsical capelets and bloomers with pleats and gathers to explore “everything the color has to offer.” She did the same with jersey in a run of perfectly weird dresses: “I created these silhouettes by adding fabric rather than taking,” she said of the volume she draped into the hips and hems of the frocks.Allen has a curious but compelling way of describing her clothing, both esoteric and playfully familiar. Of her bright orange hue, she said that it was “a way of using color as the starting point of a sort of spiritual embodiment,” but then added that she found the way it resembled a peach when rendered in velvet “delicious,” as in she’d “take a bite out of it.” Ditto the charming and strangely sexy collages of fabric remnants she stitched onto a mesh dress and a blouse: “I was thinking of baby chicks, when they go from fluffy baby feathers to adult feathers. I became obsessed with the level of texture and density in that awkward phase.” This manner of speaking makes the witchiness of her clothes all the more alluring; it makes them real and sincere.Elsewhere, Allen created a run of deliciously slippery silk twill basics—a slip, bloomers, and pants—which she complemented with mesh underwear and tailored capris. A charming shirtdress was made in the shape of a Victorian dressing gown; she twisted and crushed its pleats and left the hems of its trims raw. “I was looking back at when people owned only four dresses, so they would all have that worn-in kind of softness,” said Allen.The real hit here was a fleece jacket she lined in silk, except she made the shell smaller than the interior, so its lining poured out of its hems and sleeves. She added a hook-and-eye—the signature closure throughout her collection—to the back princess seams that when closed created a charming mini bustle. The bonus: The jackets are reversible, and when worn inside out, the lining creates “a billowing sort of blouse.” It’s this kind of frisky ingenuity that has captivated Allen’s audience thus far; she should make sure to preserve it as she flourishes.', 'At the Collina Strada spring 2025 show, held in a small private park in the East Village, a model somersaulted onto the runway; grabbed a chunk of grass with her bare hand; playfully threw it at Paramore’s Hayley Williams, who was sitting front row; and sauntered away in a mix of artful dancing, acrobatics, and death drops that were more akin to diving into the earth. Hillary Taymour had titled this collection Touch Grass.“I feel like everyone is a bit overwhelmed this season,” she explained a few days earlier at a preview at her studio. “There’s a lot of chaotic energy with everything that’s happening on the planet and the election, and so I’m just trying to be grateful that I have a small, healthy business; trying to find inner peace, keep a smile on my face, and not get overwhelmed.”Outside, the sun set on Manhattan and a gentle breeze began blowing exactly as the second model, in a diaphanous slip dress with twisting and undulating long sleeves in a print that could very well be called “colors of the wind” made her way down the runway, her long, crimped blonde hair with the ends dyed green dragging on the ground behind her. Groovy jazz music was on the soundtrack. A few minutes into the show and it was evident everyone was enjoying a genuinely lovely New York City day.Just as lovely, and also romantic, were the clothes. A plethora of ruffles decorated asymmetrical dresses, barely there slip dresses, and even the back of a terrific tailored black satin jacket worn as part of a suit. Shell tops in lace and mesh were decorated with gathers or pleats or even sculpted flowers; classic sweatshirts had billowing chiffon sleeves; and chunky mesh boots were worn with ruffly lace socks (the first from the designer’s own in-house brand). Even the less outwardly femme pieces still had a certain softness about them—see the plaid tweed jacket paired with a washed striped button-down shirt and a bubbly little doughnut pouf of a miniskirt.Prints were delivered two ways—in levels of brightly saturated color or washed as if they’d been picked up at the beach after being in the sun and the salt water, banging against the rocks for several weeks. Although the color palette was largely made up of pastels, it was grounded by a series of all-black looks at the end, as well as bold turquoise.Halfway through the show, Ashlee Simpson’s 2004 song “Pieces of Me” started playing on the soundtrack, except this was a bossa nova version with the lyrics changed to be about Collina Strada and eating one’s vegetables. Everything about it was charming and, crucially, self-assured. “We’re still trying to have a fun, goofy Collina, but in a grown way,” Taymour said. She certainly accomplished it. There was a sense that after a few seasons where the designer seemed to be exploring the limits of a certain kind of maximalism, she’d decided to strip everything back and find the singular essence that makes Collina Strada. The closing model wore a black lace top with matching black bloomers and pushed an “analog” lawn mower while sporting a pair of glasses from the designer’s newly launched sunglasses line like he was breaking ground before planting a garden.', '“What I create is nothing but an expression of my own issues, of what’s inside my head. It’s all about my own values. Of course, I understand those who don’t agree. I accept them. That is freedom.” So says Rei Kawakubo in an interview that’s part of next month’s Vogue Japan cover story. That article also features an excellent editorial shoot dedicated to last season’s collection, which Kawakubo said was motivated by anger. Today’s, as paraphrased by her husband, Adrian Joffe, in the backstage receiving line, was more redemptive: “With the state of the world as it is, the future as uncertain as it is, if you put air and transparency into the mix of things, there could be the possibility of hope.”The show opened with a triptych of looks that were all white and all rigid. They looked to be in a resin-coated fabric or even something akin to fiberglass. Along with that rigidity, the almost Doric ridges of these structures’ surfaces, plus the deliberate slowness with which their valiant models were obliged to walk, lent them a monumental gravitas. They turned out also to be sculptural toiles of looks to come. These later equivalents were clad in fabrics, silk jacquards to the eye, whose patterning could have stemmed from multiple transnational traditions across Asia and Africa. The stiff ridges of before had transformed into strongly upholstered quilting, soft this time. These supersize structures featured oversized sleeves or sometimes unused armholes.Around them were shown looks that swaddled the models with metal mesh structures filled with material that sometimes resembled insulation down, or were other times encased in a further layer of photo-print fabric. Just glimpse-able as one dress passed was a collage of what looked like protest placards: “Protect our…” I read, before the model moved the message out of sight.Further looks swathed the models in a supersize cone of white filament clad in gold-flecked gauze and garlanded with scarlet tulle. There was a white bow-shaped structure shrouded in white fishnet that was waisted by another scarlet bow. There were more package dresses, composed of multiple conjoined sections of bagged material, sometimes patterned in an abstracted scarlet on white relief. At the end came a final triptych of wearable architecture: three mega-dresses fashioned from what resembled rolled cylinders or scrunched lumps of wrapping plastic. In that Vogue Japan interview, Kawakubo said, “I only create things that I think are new and that I myself am stimulated by.” Today she delivered another dose of powerful unfamiliarity for us to interrogate and savor.', 'Commission’s Dylan Cao and Jin Kay took a break last season in order to align themselves with the menswear calendar. This kind of reset brought them back to a familiar question they’ve been investigating for a number of years now: What is Americanness, specifically within the context of being an immigrant? They were “looking at first generations that came here before us, in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s, and how they tried to assimilate, whether by dressing up using elements of American preppiness or wearing a 9-to-5 suit 24/7 to show that they’re ‘excellent,’” Cao explained in their Midtown studio.Many of the classic signifiers of American sportswear are present in the collection, just distorted through the designers’ singular lens. Polo shirts and zip-up hoodies are cut at an angle so they pull and drape to one side when worn; it is a subtle effect that reads not as deconstructed or reworked but as a regular piece of clothing that the wearer simply needs to straighten out—except of course there is no straightening to be done. A T-shirt designed to be worn inside out and backward had a label that read EXCELLENT CLASSICS / IMPORTED VISION.In the past the Commission silhouette has been oversized, but this season everything is coming back close to the body—so close, in fact, that their button-down shirts and shirtdresses are scrunched up, with the buttons seemingly pulling from opposite sides as if they were too small and need to be forced to fit together. Elsewhere, a tailored jacket has been turned into a skirt, with the jacket’s shoulder padding—sans sleeves—left exposed, becoming a kind of peplum in the process. Knits with their signature slits at the chest have been replaced with a cutout at the back. This is more discreet but also allows for the pieces to be worn in a different way, like they’ve been laid flat on top of the body—as if the wearer is trying Americanness on for size, not entirely sure it fits.', 'Among many other things, Conner Ives is an excellent storyteller. As he talked through his latest collection, titled Camelot, the designer spun a rip-roaring yarn of a journey from the medieval lords and ladies of Arthurian legend to the invocation of Camelot by Jackie O to describe the Kennedy administration, all the way to the winking subversion of American history employed by Cole Escola in the Broadway hit Oh, Mary!Though for Ives, who was born and raised in upstate New York before moving to London to study at Central Saint Martins, it was less a case of storytelling per se and more about exploring the rich American tradition of mythmaking. “It was recently the 10-year anniversary of me moving to the UK, which is insane,” he said. “I started thinking about that unwavering entrepreneurial spirit of being American, and how a lot of my work is in pursuit of identifying traits of Americana that aren’t just, you know, the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’ and red, white, and blue.”Where Ives’s first few collections saw him scroll through a rogue’s gallery of American female archetypes (from Swans to Y2K Hollywood starlets, Chelsea Girls to Real Housewives), he has changed tack slightly over the past few seasons, homing in with anthropological intensity on a tighter pool of inspirations. And this time around, the layering of centuries—medieval England, 1960s Americana, the international It girl of today—made for a surprisingly effective sartorial palimpsest. Slinky knit dresses with trumpet skirts were inspired by cotehardies, a kind of medieval underlayer here reinterpreted as something resembling a Henley top, while jacquard knitwear took its cues from the elaborate motifs found on 17th-century clocked stockings. A sleek and very ’90s striped white mini dress featured a playful tulle bustle. A motif of what appeared to be a magician on horseback cropped up across spaghetti strap tops and as a panel on striped boxing shorts that were trimmed with lace.There were a handful of new riffs on some of Ives’s signatures too: notably his elastic-thread shirred technique, which appeared in the form of painterly floral tops and mini dresses as well as a pair of blazing red pedal pushers. Oh, and plenty of fabulous dresses for the loyal coterie of glamorous party girls that surround him, from a swishy mauve pink dress hand-painted with wonky polka dots to his final “bridal” look, a silk jersey column dress with a dramatic vintage fox-fur collar. (The ever-resourceful Ives whizzed it up from offcuts of a custom look he recently created for Rihanna.) “Everything is kind of an assemblage of different centuries and different dress codes and different cultures coming together, which I think also reflects that sense of American mythmaking at play,” he said, “this idea that these things could be constantly taken apart and collaged back together—that you could take a bustle and put it on a polo shirt.”', 'There’s a calming effect to a visit with Connor McKnight. It’s not just his clothes, but the designer himself. McKnight radiates a serenity that pairs well with the nonchalant modernity of his collection. To put it plainly, McKnight is a pretty chill guy.That could be why he built his new collection around ease. “I’m leaning in,” he explained. “Now that I’m 30, the challenge-just-for-challenge’s-sake doesn’t really resonate with me.” He can say that again. As we get older, we tend to get better at choosing our battles and taking the path of least resistance. It’s not about coasting through life, but about learning. “I’m getting better at identifying what is working for me and letting that become my focus,” he said.Menswear is one of those things. While McKnight has expanded into womenswear little by little, this collection emphasizes his menswear sensibilities. “I think people see me as men’s first, and that is something I can lean into because it comes easier to me,” he said. He plans on carving out the space for more expansive offerings in the next couple of seasons, encompassing his menswear and some women’s-specific looks with sizing that is interchangeable, “but I want to give that a little more time to develop,” he said.As that marinates in the background, McKnight has also embraced his sense of play. He doubled-down on his signature crop silhouette with high-waisted trousers and funky cropped knits and blazers, but added a longer leather jacket “to speak to those who don’t love the crop.” There’s a roundness to his collection, with bubbled hems created by drawstrings and with curved gusseted pockets that have a softening and modernizing effect on the often austere tone of his clothes.Stemming from his knack for working with deadstock fabrics, McKnight cut pants and jackets out of repurposed military tents and camping bug mesh “I see people like transparency these days!” he laughed, adding, “it’s a fun process, there’s a pre-worn aspect and texture to the clothing that I’m really into.” McKnight’s clothes generally come with a lived-in patina, and this extension allows for more novelty and depth. The plan is to offer them as part of a direct-to-consumer expansion, and work with interested retailers to sell exclusive versions based on the materials he can find. But all in due time. The hunt and the process, McKnight said, is part of the fun.', 'Now that was a show. There was naive youth and disaffected youth. There were villains, mermaids, princesses, lightning, fireworks, rats, and Kylie Jenner. For those who dared, the after party included the chance to ride Hyperspace Mountain (epic). When I regretfully exited Disneyland Paris at the stroke of midnight, techno still echoed through the Magic Kingdom. Being part of Fashion Month always feels like inhabiting an alternate (un)reality: this was an extra twist in the wormhole.Backstage in Cinderella’s banquet hall Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant said they had been prepping for this event, the first fashion show ever held at any Disneyland Paris, for two years. Added Vaillant: “When they first approached us it was to do a small collaboration: Sébastien suggested that maybe we could do a show together at some point. We didn’t realize how huge this would become.”Disney really delivered on the partnership. The show was held in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. At the show’s finale the castle was framed with fireworks, spark-sprays, bolts of lightning and more. It seems churlish to mention the rodents we spotted scampering on the drawbridge just before the show started—“Ratatouille,” shouted one benchmate—but uninvited guests in the house of mouse added to the surreal wonder of the moment.The collection, Coperni’s largest ever, they said, was broadly divided into three narrative sections for the purposes of the show. “We like this idea of fairy tales and the evolution from childhood to adulthood that we can see in the Disney movies in general,” said Vaillant. At the beginning, everything seemed sweet. Ruffle-edged white floral jacquard jackets worn north of bloomers were meant to be a nod to the turn of the 20th century birth of Walt Disney, plus the corporation’s penchant for gothic revival in its castle architecture. Butterflies crafted from organza fluttered on scuba surfaces. Those butterflies signaled a metamorphosis from wide-eyed wonder to slouchy seen-it-alls: park rats. The designers mixed real vintage Disney merch shirts with fresh reinventions—‘Coperni princess’ was my fave, along with a shirt featuring Lumiere the candlestick, scorch marks and the phrase ‘I’ve been burned by you before’—with denim and embroidered shirting. There was a fairytale pair of jeans matched with a house Swipe bag that had both been encrusted, somehow permanently, with salt crystals.', 'The Courrèges invitation was a metal Möbius strip, and its infinite-loop nature provided a clue about Nicolas Di Felice’s designs for spring. Where many of the skin-baring looks appeared to be two pieces—a tank dress worn with a bandeau bra, say—they were in fact one. He achieved this particular item by designing the halter-style dress with a neck hole topped by a horizontal strap: Slip your head in, and stretch that strap around the chest—there are snaps at the side—et voilàa.“In the period that we live in, it’s always a comeback to something else—and I’m not talking only about fashion—so I decided we’re going to work on cycles and repetition,” he said at a studio preview. “The Möbius ribbon expresses it really well: A simple piece of paper becomes something where there’s no beginning or end—no inside, no outside.”If that sounds complicated, there was nothing conceptual or contrived about the outcome. Di Felice pointed to an archival cape in duchesse satin from André Courrèges’s winter 1962 show as the launchpad for this exercise, but the collection was sexy in a way that he’s made his own: young, confident, party-ready, both hot and cool.Expanding on the Möbius-strip idea, Di Felice created trousers with an additional piece of fabric extending from the outer seam of one leg then crossing between the legs to connect behind the other one on the outer seam. I can’t remember ever seeing something like the half-pant, half-skirt hybrid results on the runway. Also on theme was a wisp of a dress that, when laid flat, was a circle with a smaller circle for an armhole. Twisted around the body with the help of some light boning—yes, like a Möbius—it’s precisely the kind of thing young women want to wear out to the club.Di Felice’s summer residency at Jean Paul Gaultier, where he guest designed a couture collection, has raised his profile. There were screaming fans by the hundreds outside today waiting for Wooyoung from the South Korean boy band Ateez. It also might’ve boosted his ambition. Originally, he wanted to do 40 of the same looks. “But,” he said, “I thought it might be a bit too cynical for me. It’s not really me to be cynical.” Instead, he worked in a cycle, evolving his modern version of that 1962 cape: His comes with an exaggerated hood, into a coat with a martingale in back, into that halter dress with a bandeau, and so on. In a less skilled designer’s hands, the repetition built into the process could’ve proved boring. The opposite was true here: It was a CV for everything Di Felice can do—from sexy clubwear all the way up to the hautest of couture shapes.', 'For the first time in his near-15 year career, David Koma decided to take a beat and skip a fashion show or even a formal presentation this season. In part you suspected this might be related to his new duties at Blumarine: Koma came straight to Paris from spending Milan Fashion Week with his new colleagues there. Once we caught up in his Paris showroom, however, the designer demurred; he explained that he was cooking up big things for the anniversary in February, so for now: “I thought let me just focus on the whole range and quality and explore the magic that can be on the rail.”That magic seemed to be casting its spell on the happy wholesale clients who were keeping Koma’s team busy. “There are extreme cuts, extreme decadence, extreme opulence,” summarized the designer of a collection that he said was inspired by the Australian photographer Layly Jeffress’s studio shot portraits of birds. More specifically, he said: “I chose the hummingbird for this extreme, hyper energy. And swallows for the sense of family and togetherness.” Less thematically but equally dramatically, there was a fair amount of turkey: today the so-called marabou feathers we see in fashion tend to be sourced from America’s favorite traditional celebratory main course.A balconette bra and mini skort in fluro yellow was wreathed in a floor length feather trimmed tulle veil. A pale blue crystal fixed lycra bodysuit was worn under a sleeveless hoodie in same-tone marabou. This powerful hoodie also came long-sleeved, in pink. Koma being Koma, there was a powerfully defined all-evening section in black. A mini-dress was edged at the bosom with a livery of pink feathers. Slouchy-cut tailoring was accented with a metal chain that draped from the right shoulder over to the breast pocket; at its end was tethered an embroidered flower. Fashion more broadly is going through a moment of self-reflection about how best to express powerful, self-determined, feminine hotness: that’s a lane David Koma has been on for as long as he’s been a designer.', 'Beyond being an adventurous traveler, Daniel Del Core is proving himself a storyteller as well. For his spring collection, he envisioned a studious, dedicated scientist who, despite her serious demeanor, is also an obsessive-compulsive fashion type and clearly a Del Core loyalist. The narrative followed her daily routine, from the sterile environment of her lab (she doesn’t leave home without stacks of ponderous tomes like Hannah Arendt’s The Human Condition and Susan Sontag’s Against Interpretation tucked into her bag) to the dark hours when she sheds her pristine chrysalis and transforms into an extravagant creature of the night—a new breed of translucent scarab or perhaps praying mantis.Literal references or overt narration can be a risky path, but Del Core navigated it rather deftly. He is shifting the focus of his ready-to-wear shows toward daywear, while his more flamboyant creations will be displayed during January’s Couture Week in Paris. This decision seems to have unlocked a new sense of clarity, resulting in a more disciplined approach. Today’s collection’s edit appeared sharper, reflecting a newfound balance.The opening looks—a series of flowing, oversized white organza trench coats and layered separates—referenced pristine lab coats. As the collection progressed, it introduced more substantial pieces: slightly oversized pantsuits with tapered trousers and cropped, fitted leather jackets worn over shorts, all with practical, sellable appeal.Yet it’s with eveningwear where Del Core truly excels. He’s mastered couture-level craft; a growing list of celebrities—including Florence Welch, Sharon Stone, Lupita Nyong’o, Eva Green, and Björk—have graced the red carpet in his creations. The five closing looks were particularly impactful, especially a dramatic black cape dress in structured, pleated organza with a distinctive Cruella de Vil sci-fi edge. The finale was rather spectacular, with Naomi Campbell, draped in a finely pleated white column dress, embodying the goddess she is.', 'The winds of change are blowing at Derek Lam 10 Crosby.If that line sounds familiar, it’s because just over a year ago, last summer, this very writer used it to open the label’s resort 2024 review. Back then, designer Kate Wallace had just been brought onto the label to give it a revamp. That’s old news now. Wallace has left the brand, with design director Yana Popov taking the reins.For her first spring lineup as lead designer, Popov enlisted the New York artist Jill Moser to collaborate with. Moser’s gestural paintings and her idiosyncratic use of color served as Popov’s starting point here. The designer looked at Moser’s paint layering and knack for featuring bright “impossible” colors as part of her work to create her color palette. The result was a fresh and contemporary lineup that played up Lam’s original design vernacular—a sophisticated outlook with a touch of utility.', 'When Cretan princess Ariadne hatched a plan to kill the labyrinth-dwelling Minotaur with her lover Theseus, she bestowed him with a ball of thread, so he could lead himself from the maze after completing the murderous deed. This got Athens-based Dimitra Petsa—whose Greek mythology-exploring collections draw on Persephone\\'s transformation into the queen of the underworld and the homecoming of Odysseus—to thinking about the symbol of the horned Minotaur, half-human, half-bull, as a reflection of the shadow and light that exist within women. If our body is a complex labyrinth, then for Petsa, the thread that will lead us through darkness for spring 2025 is female self-pleasure. “It’s a concept that has always been viewed as very low-brow, but people don’t give value to the divine power that it has,” she said.Frustrated by the polarizing Madonna-whore complex bestowed on women, or the medicalized and sexualized binaries they are restricted by, Petsa has used her catwalk to give center stage to societally hidden pregnant bodies since she launched her brand in 2019, using her signature wet-look illusion dresses to emphasize bulging bumps. For spring she doubled down on taboos associated with the female body: a skintight mini-dress featured a lactating nipple print; skimpy red-tinged bikini bottoms evoked the stains of menstruation blood; draped mesh trousers in dégradé blues and turquoises appeared as if drenched in bodily fluid; \"masturbation denim,” included low-rise jeans with a distressed triangular pocket at the crotch. “They’re designed to look like they\\'ve been really rubbed,” Petsa said with a smile.The self-pleasure theme of the collection took shape out of the disintegration of Petsa’s long-term relationship. “I was living in turbulence, and the only lifeboat was my vagina,” the designer said, discussing the role her own body took as an anchor. As a result of the break-up, she reconnected with her male friends, considering how menswear rarely explores “the divinity of clothing” and the potency it can impress onto the body. Spring saw a solid expansion into daring menswear: body-sculpting pleated shirting and wet-look tracksuits; crotch-emphasizing “hard-on” denim, plus a metal codpiece and talismanic nipple jewels, which a handcraft-obsessed Petsa made herself.With a degree in performance art, Petsa often incorporates herself into her body-diverse theatrical shows, through live music or a poetry recital. For spring she instead played a theatrical voice of god (correction: goddess!), pre-recording an invocation to self-pleasure that boomed across the catwalk. Models gestured with blood-stained fingers and rouged mouths, mimicked Minotaur horns with their hands, and walked with sand-stained hair and tan line-stained bodies as if straight from a sordid romp on the beach. As a final choreographed tableau, a topless male model wrapped the other inclusive bodies on the catwalk with a blood red ball of yarn, each navigating their own internal labyrinth, where masturbation is not maligned, but mythologized.', '“Diesel is denim.” So droned the AI voice that had already read and re-read the Wikipedia entry on denim before this show started. We contemplated an arresting and scary ocean of denim scraps and off-cuts that had been brought in from Diesel facilities then spread across the floor of the cavernous out-of-town hangar in which the show was held again this season. As well as looking so unsettlingly striking, this gesture was meant to emphasize how under the design direction of Glenn Martens and the direction of the Rosso clan this brand has pivoted from using three percent to 57 percent regenerative, organic, or recycled cotton in the manufacture of its core material. Considering the scale of Diesel’s business, that is a significant achievement.Diesel’s reinvention of denim applies to product as well as process. Chatting before the show, Martens mooted that around 80 per cent of this collection’s looks contained it. At the beginning, this was mostly self-evident: distressed and tufted hot pants, washed five-pocket classics with pressed creases, spaghetti-strap dresses, skirts and denim-jersey separates with shaggily horizontal loose weave sections. Then it became harder to parse. The tailored pieces and dresses in prince of wales check were, it turns out, printed denim—there to show how a garment with a refined and precious facade could be rendered as robustly tough as workwear.Without having had the chance to check, I’d wager that the next section’s starring garments—the outerwear and dresses edged with enormous reefs of fringing at the collar and neckline—were denim-free (and I’d probably lose). Denim or not, their banks of sliced tendrils loosely tied as both decoration and support made their wearers attractively appear as if they’d narrowly escaped a close call with an office shredder.Accessories included wraparound shades whose frames were in production roughed up to be all individually different in detail and patina, and a new handbag whose name, the Double D, honored the Diesel branding tradition and was broadcast buxomly in its shape. There was denim boucle, denim jacquard, and a Neo from The Matrix style monkish gown in embossed (not treated) indigo denim before a closing section of tied and wrapped jersey garments printed with vintage Diesel scarves that shifted the pattern a little. “We’ve been doing a lot of different things here over the last few seasons, so I think this was the moment to remind everyone about our denim again,” said Martens. He certainly achieved his aim.', 'At Diotima’s spring presentation, the room was set with bunches of lit red candles on top of sand and concrete blocks like so many little altars. The models came out and circled the tableau, round and around like an incantation. It’s not that anyone needs the help of the supernatural to fall in love with Rachel Scott’s vision of womanhood, but the effect was hypnotizing. Her signature crochet dresses—sinuously showing skin underneath all manner of sequins, paillettes, and other embellishments—were present: A standout included an intarsia knit dress with swooping shapes in cream and wine that she had physically mapped on a model’s body so it perfectly enveloped the wearer. Unfortunately this look, along with many other terrific pieces that walked at the presentation, was not included in this season’s look book. That’s because this season it was Scott’s vision for the everyday that took center stage.Following her collections throughout the years, it has been exciting to see how she has slowly and carefully expanded the diversity of her offerings while fine-tuning her design vocabulary. It is both a natural creative instinct and a way to make her pieces accessible to a wider audience. “So many of the things I do are time-consuming and intricate and therefore expensive, and I want to find a way to do things in a more approachable way,” she said at her presentation while a line of well-wishers waited for the chance to speak or take a selfie with her. “I love combining crochet with wovens. There’s always this fluidity and undoneness, and I wanted to find a way to do that in new materials.”See the loose-fitting jeans with delicate broderie anglaise insets on the legs; a finely woven cotton shirt with an elastic waistband for a slight balloon effect; a terrific suit with a high-low hem—inspired by the classic morning-coat shape—which she paired with drop-crotch wide-leg Bermuda shorts. Scott melted metallic paillettes and used them to embellish the edges of a wrap linen skirt paired with a very thin striped turtleneck, its high collar made from crochet. Another draped dress in mint green and gray superfine Japanese jersey had a black crochet appliqué on one side. It evoked the ocean in the swaying curves of the material and yet felt approachable because of the familiarity of its material.', 'At Dolce & Gabbana, blondes do have more fun. The designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana have lately noticed a solemnity that’s descended over the fashion industry. “Fashion is a serious business—I know—but maybe now it’s too serious,” Dolce said. Their idea for spring was to take us to the movies; they channeled cinema’s most glamorous blondes—Marilyn Monroe, Monica Vitti, Marlene Dietrich—with platinum wigs, pin-up dresses, and rigid-cupped bras. Between quiet luxury and bullet bras, it’s no contest.Madonna, who famously revived this 1950s look at the peak of her fame 30-odd years ago, was in the audience today. Jean Paul Gaultier was responsible for her Blond Ambition cone bras, but let’s not forget that Dolce and Gabanna designed costumes for her Girlie Show tour in 1993, in support of her album Erotica. At the time, her controversy-stirring coffee table book Sex was hot off the presses and the pop superstar was doing her part “to liberate America—free us all of our hang-ups,” as she famously said. When the designers greeted her after today’s show, the lip readers in the room could see her saying, “I want everything” from beneath her black lace veil.On the runway, the bras were worn as lingerie, peeking out from underneath a classic trench or above a balconette-bodice dress. Or they were designed into the looks, from stretchy cocktail numbers to sartorial jackets. A double-breasted black satin tuxedo with built-in cone-shaped cups was a real feat of pattern-making; there are very few labels that could pull it off with such convincing aplomb.Dolce and Gabbana have been reconsidering their oeuvre in the lead-up to the 40th anniversary of their brand. After last season’s ode to the tux, here they let some light in. A light pink long-sleeved sheath, modest save for the provocative bullet-bra bodice, was modeled on a photo of a young, smiling Marilyn Monroe. There was a strapless number with the same ingenue spirit in baby blue, and the lush florals were also pretty, especially the bold red rose print on a white ground.And the viability of the bullet bra? It’s actually turned up on a couple of red carpets this year. Now that the nipple has been freed, padded and pointy is just a swing of the fashion pendulum. The models descended a mirrored staircase lit up like a movie set. It was easy enough to imagine starlets snapping these dresses up for the red carpet—as well as the many women who long to look like them.', 'Now going into its third season, the relaunched Donna Karan label has found a niche with modern working women that are living full lives before and after toiling at their nine-to-five job. There are no trends to be found here, no quiet luxury basics, and certainly no boho-chic pieces; instead the team has zeroed in on continuing the Donna Karan DNA, with somewhat minimalist silhouettes that are body conscious, and have an emphasis on soft textures.For spring 2025 there are slinky silver separates with bold gold brushstrokes—a motif pulled straight from the archives—jersey separates with Robert Lee Morris hardware (also pulled from the archives), and a wide array of knits, from chunky cable knit sweaters to sensual floral crochets. Donna Karan’s focus on the shoulders continued this season, with an elegant slim vest with a criss-cross neck, ideal for those day-to-night days. Elsewhere, the team looked for inspiration in nature, creating geometric patterns based on water ripples that added a dose of sensuality to the lineup; some done in sequin embroideries and others in an all-over abstract, textural material. The color palette followed this path, from grays and silvers to beiges and tans to black and white and ultimately yellow.', 'Dries Van Noten retired from the runway after putting on his last show at the men’s collections in June, a moving swansong attended by throngs of his designer peers and scores of journalists, many of whom became customers over the years. Despite the never-ending game of designer musical chairs, Van Noten’s exit hits different. The big houses changing hands were launched decades ago (in Chanel’s case, over a century ago); new creative directors come in with a mandate to refresh legacies, not to replace a living founder. With that hard-to-fill job at DVN still open, this collection was the work of the label’s design studio. And so as the models made their way around the runway the thoughts running through minds were: What’s changed?In brief, this was more familiar than it was different. Van Noten’s lush colors, pattern mixes, and embroidery work were all in evidence, “converging,” as the show notes expressed, “along an optimistic path, extending from the earliest women’s collections through what lies ahead.”A bit of online sleuthing revealed that the fall ’97 show in particular was a touchstone, with its jewel tones, flower mixes, and blending of eastern and western codes of dress. Reissues have become standard issue in fashion recently, a reliable way to tap into our collective nostalgia and young people’s curiosity about the fashions of their parents’ generation. So fair enough for the DVN team to go the archive route, especially for lifting from this foundational collection, which came just three years after Van Noten launched his women’s line.Where it seemed to diverge from known and loved Van Noten collections was in its reliance on lingerie touches: a marigold lace bandeau under a khaki blouson jacket; the silky tap pants that accompanied a pinstripe blazer; a fuchsia jacquard coat; and an embroidered evening jacket. But hooking a new gen on Dries Van Noten is part of the remit now, no doubt, and so Dries lovers will have to get accustomed to change. There’s surely more to come at this house, even if Van Noten remains a presence, as he did today, seated inconspicuously near the backstage entrance, but there all the same.I was seated near the most committed of Van Noten fans, a woman whose closet is full of his clothes collected over the course of many years, and the look that got her camera phone clicking—a roomy floral jacquard knit vest over a chartreuse button-down and crinkly silver-blue cropped pants—had his trademark shouldn’t-work-but-it-does mix. I happen to have a fair bit of the designer’s pieces in my closet too, and the standout look for me involved his classic but relaxed tailoring, in the form of a pinstriped blazer tucked into paper-bag waist pants—still very Dries.', 'The audience attending the Dsquared2 show at Milan’s Teatro Lirico was in for a surprise, served up by the Caten twins in top showman form. Once the plush red velvet curtains opened, red-lit glass cages descended from the ceiling, with (scantily clad) male dancers engaging in a rather hot performance—at least by fashion show standards. The Catens were probably after the history books.Called #D2HEAT, the co-ed show delivered on its promises. The theater, a Milanese landmark where in its heydays Italian operas and Bertolt Brecht political cabarets were staged, was bathed in red light and transformed into the set for a “soft sado parade of delicate bondage,” as the Catens said at a preview. Being the kings of mashups, they turned up the kink, going muscular and spectacular. Sheer chiffon and latex in every possible shade of nude were juxtaposed with the “harder sexual tones” of black leather and sharp metallic shimmers; an unrestrained variety of skin-tight harnesses, chains coiling up legs, slashes revealing bare skin, S&M strappings and bracings and wrestlers’ regalia made the case for “a nod at Tom of Finland, but a delicate, soft Tom,” they said.The feel was redolent of the gay underground culture of the ’80s, when the Catens were club kids eager for excitement and cool. The characters of that milieu—poets, artists, misfits—were the inspiration for tonight’s extravaganza, which had Prince’s “Cream” and “Erotic City” on the soundtrack. Things have changed, everything seems so much safer and bland now. “We try to stick to that sense of excitement though, or at least we try to dream,” they said. “It’s about theater more than sexuality. Theater is inside us. And if we had no courage, if we didn’t dare, it wouldn’t be us.”', 'It was standing room only at Duran Lantink’s show. The Dutch designer picked up LVMH’s Karl Lagerfeld Prize earlier this month, so his early adopters were joined by people curious to discover what the LVMH jury saw in him. If I had to guess, I would say it’s his flair for the surreal and a commitment to his unique vision. The Lagerfeld Prize recognizes the “creativity of young brands.”There’s an absurdist streak running through the spring collections, a rejection of the straight and narrow and the safety that designers, who’ve been buffeted by strong economic headwinds, have been pursuing lately. This season, they have turned to risk-taking, ingenuity, and fun. Lantink has represented all of that since the COVID days, when he used drone footage to make one of the pandemic era’s most creative fashion films to showcase his repurposed unsold designer clothes.In the seasons since, he’s pivoted his focus to extremes of silhouette, shaping an avant-garde aesthetic that, despite its exaggeration of form—or maybe because of it—is now resonating IRL on the street. Model Rianne Van Rompaey, who is also Dutch, was at the show today in a cropped black leather bomber with linebacker padding on the shoulders and upper torso, which is one of Lantink’s signatures.This season, the designer went to the beach, inserting inner tubes of padding in one-piece swimsuits and adding several cup sizes and generous uplift to bikini tops. Full-body bodysuits, meanwhile, were padded at the joints, making the models resemble insects or aliens—weird stuff. Other looks were accessorized with handbags worn as bonnets, the straps tucked under the chin. It was almost as if Lantink was compensating for the more commercial instincts of the T-shirt fabric he used for a slouchy trench and corset-waist dresses. “It was really important to think a bit more about wearability, but still in a very fun way,” he said.The exceptional silver jewelry belonged to Carla Sozzani and was made by her companion, Kris Ruhs. The sculptural necklaces claimed space in a similar way to Lantink’s bold designs.', 'You can hear a Duro Olowu presentation before you see it. Walking up the stairs to the apartment he borrowed from a friend to show his clothes this season—the interiors a maximalist riot of patterns and prints wholly befitting Olowu’s own eye for clashing extremes—you could hear the peals of laughter echoing down the corridor as the designer regaled the assembled crowd of editors with the stories behind each piece. “Sometimes people say, how come we end up laughing so much at these previews?” Olowu added. “Well, I think if you’re not laughing, you’re not having fun.”If there was an operative word within Olowu’s spring collection, it was certainly fun—but while there are plenty of looks to put a smile on your face, the technical rigor behind each piece is no laughing matter. A trio of tailored opening outfits in a blazing sunflower yellow—a trench coat cut just so at the calf, and a pair of pantsuits, one roomy, one cinched—were cleverly configured to be mixed and matched at will. A 1920s-inspired coat and a series of separates and swishy dresses featured an especially lovely striped print that Olowu likened to the endpapers you might find in Victorian books, patchworked in contrasting colors and meticulously seamed together on the diagonals where the points of the bias meet. “I wanted that familiarity but still that strangeness,” said Olowu. “It’s about taking a delicate pattern and making it quite bold.”There was plenty more boldness to come: multi-print bias dresses with ravishing clashes of romantic florals and geometric block prints, or with ruffled trims on the sleeves; knee-length coats with kick flare black slub silk trousers poking out from underneath to dance around the models’ ankles; boxy duster coats with playful polka-dot buttons; and an especially dazzling jacket cut from a wild combination of gold lamé, chenille, and raffia. “I wanted each piece to feel like its own living, pulsating thing,” Olowu said.As always, however, look a little closer—beyond the kaleidoscopic mish-mash of florals and polka-dots and rowdy prints—and every detail was rooted in Olowu’s obsession with practicality. The hoodies he introduced last season proved to be a surprise hit among his art world-adjacent clientele, and they made a return here, styled with nothing but a pair of sandals. A supremely elegant take on a bomber jacket, featuring precisely cut bell sleeves, is likely to be this season’s best-seller, and the dressed-up-but-laid-back look of a sleeveless, paneled tuxedo jacket and trousers was so winning it elicited a sharp intake of breath from the assembled editors. “It’s about turning it down, but revving it up,” the designer said. If anyone can translate that seemingly paradoxical sentiment into beautiful clothes, it’s Olowu.', 'Stepping into Dušan’s showroom, nestled in an elegant building on a quiet Milan street, feels like entering a preternaturally serene space, filled with museum-worthy ancient and Egyptian art treasures (he’s an eager collector) surrounded by an extraordinary installation of bonsai trees.Dušan Paunovic exists in a world of his own—he’s resistant to novelties, serves a loyal, upper-crust clientele that has stuck with him for over 25 years (and wear Dušan alongside Hermès and Loro Piana) and despises the word “trend.” “I don’t do trends,” he stated. “You won’t find the latest craze here. What you will find are designs that I adjust slightly each season, but fundamentally remain unchanged. It’s my formula—each year you can add new pieces without needing to discard what you bought the season before.”Paunovic honed his craft at the Milan atelier of the legendary designer Zoran in the ’90s. “I’m his only legitimate heir,” he said. He has carried forward a style that was an early forerunner of minimalism. Zoran, a visionary and highly exacting designer, worked exclusively with the finest fabrics, which complemented his linear, luxurious creations. Fiercely independent (and self-funded) like his master, Paunovic remains true to his philosophy: “You have to stay consistent and authentic to who you are.” He meticulously perfects every garment, ensuring the cut, fit, and details are flawless. His signature designs feature loose, fluid, and oversized shapes—coats and jackets are offered in a single size. His curated wardrobe includes a handful of thoughtfully designed pieces crafted from exquisite fabrics: a flowing oversized kimono trench coat, a slightly more fitted unstructured batwing jacket for this season, wide-leg pajama pants with an elasticated waist (this season he added an option in the softest suede), and square-cut tops that look terribly chic layered over his signature sarong skirts, which wrap around the body with ease.This season, Paunovic ventured into dresses, a category he usually avoids. “They aren’t really my thing,” he declared matter-of-factly. Nevertheless, he introduced a flattering design in ribbed viscose, featuring a fitted bodice that flares into a long skirt. He also experimented with a refreshed color palette. While he typically favors neutrals and black, he loosened his restraint, adding shades like forest green, deep burgundy, and bright Chartreuse yellow. “But I’m still unsure about that,” he said, eyeing a beautifully tailored chemise in liquid, sensuous silk satin in a soft coral pink, visibly puzzled about the bold new hue.', 'The Eckhaus Latta spring 2025 show was a dinner, I mean a show, I mean a dinner. Walking into the Tribeca loft where it was held, no one was sure what was happening but everyone was excited. Guests were asked to wear Eckhaus Latta, some were dressed in pieces from the new season. Looking around before the dinner began, I would ask guests—“Are you wearing latest season?” There was the artist Chloe Wise in a double-layered cardigan made so that the buttons scrunched as if it was too small for her—from the back it was just a single layer of fabric. She called it a “mullet cardigan.” The editor of A Magazine Blake Abbie was in a cool khaki nylon tracksuit that was all Eckhaus Latta’d out; the pants were pleated, with an extra-wide leg that had an extra-high waistline, although I couldn’t tell because it was obscured by the elastic waist of the zip-up jacket. Underneath he wore a red open weave knitted cardigan that looked like crochet. I was able to examine the trousers better on Loren Kramar, the artist who performed during last season’s show—the waistband had an extra panel underneath that created a geometrical Nehru-collar shape but at the waist. The GQ editor Samuel Hine was wearing a black nylon suit; the back of the jacket had a curved seam with laces at the bottom so that you can gather the back of the jacket and scrunch it if you like.“This season we were into taking really simple materials and playing with them,” Mike Eckhaus explained during a preview at their makeshift studio in an East Village hotel a few days before their presentation. “We call this ‘the Hugging Group’ where it’s the front of a shirt, and it’s the back of a shirt, and they loop into each other, and there’s a deconstruction to them.” Eckhaus was wearing this shirt at the dinner: it looks normal from the front, but from the back and the side it looks like two separate pieces of fabric. Another set they called the “flip group” made from cotton rib that was like two garments mirrored-flipped on each other, to be worn up or down. Last season the designers mentioned they were looking to figure out what an Eckhaus Latta basic might look like and this season it seemed like they had continued to push the boundary of how much you can explode a silhouette or a concept and have it retain its essence. “So often we think of basics as just a white T-shirt or a pair of blue jeans,” Eckhaus added. “How can we take these things and give them an edge, and a twist to them, and have them be this thing that when you see it you’re like ‘what exactly is going on?’ and then you realize, ‘oh, this is actually so everyday and simple.’”', 'Edeline Lee’s studio is situated two floors above a chaotic main road not far from Shoreditch. Home to umpteen fast-food joints and one of the last remaining pubs with burlesque poles, this is, even despite the gentrification that has torn through East London in the past 30 years, as off-map as it gets. And through an unassuming door on a side street is an almost utopian vision. Double-height ceilings, spiral staircases, and—this week—a drawing room boasting Lee’s spring 2025 collection in a palette that would rival a high-end patisserie: pale corals, banana yellows, champagne creams, and powder blues.Everything Lee sells is cut, stitched, and packaged within those four walls, and sure enough there was a clutch of seamstresses in the adjacent room slicing through reams of aqueous fabrics. The designer is proud to run an efficient production line, and her brand is animated with all kinds of smart solutions. Most of Lee’s pieces—made from a signature flou bubble jacquard—can be shoved into the bottom of a suitcase at a moment’s notice and spring back to life without so much as a crease. “My women have nonstop schedules,” the designer said. “Traveling, leading board meetings, dropping off their kids. They need a functional wardrobe that takes them day to night.” This season offered no shortage of practical options—high-waisted boot-legs, crepe de chine blouses, cinched-waist jackets, and swing dresses with adjustable sleeves—but even She-E-Os are prone to fantasy.And so Lee sent a score of showpieces around the base of the Millbank Tower in Pimlico—the former glass-and-steel headquarters of the Labour and Conservative parties and the United Nations—for her debut catwalk presentation since joining the London Fashion Week schedule in 2018. There were sequined high-neck gowns with elaborately ruffled shoulders and empire-line dresses with gathered trains. Bouffant dresses, bar jackets, and sleeveless minis were constructed with removable pannier undergarments. “I’m always thinking about comfort and fit,” the designer said. “That means giving room to the hips.” A season of firsts also included the brand’s inaugural shoe—a block-heeled court—and a children’s range worn by a cast of young models toting balloons through a happy mise-en-scène featuring Yorkshire terriers and old-fashioned bicycles.A dot print developed with artist Carolina Mazzolari evoked a child’s happy experiments in watercolors. You got the impression that Lee—a designer who refers to Donna Karan as her “spirit animal” for having established her own wardrobe of grab-and-run workwear in the ’90s—was providing her high-powered clients with a little room to dream. “I’m just hoping as many of my women as possible show up wearing the clothes,” she said. “I want the press to feel the spirit of what they’re about and why they shop with us. It’s not just about the clothes. It’s the people sitting among you.” The prime minister’s wife, Victoria Starmer, was beaming from this morning’s audience in a dress of Lee’s making.', 'Fashion’s current infatuation is with all things demure; not surprisingly, Elena Velez, a maker of “anti-fragile fashion,” isn’t having it—or at least not the way it’s served up on TikTok. It might be tempting to roll your eyes or raise an eyebrow when you hear that OnlyFans was one of the sponsors of the spring show and that the designer expanded her guest list, as is her prerogative, to include the Hallowed Sons Motorcycle Club, whom she met on a cigarette break outside of a bar in Brooklyn, as guests. Yet at a preview, the designer, who has burned many bridges, suggested she wanted to try to build them instead. I have “this longing and this desire to overcome this idea of being fashion’s problematic face or overcoming this feeling of being misunderstood and wanting to show the goodwill and the goodness that we’re trying to do with the brand.”Coming from a designer who has been labeled a provocateur, the idea of approaching things from a more positive place was more than welcome, especially as it has often felt that Velez conflated strength with aggression or started from a place of defensiveness, perhaps related to class consciousness.The personal and the political came together in a collection in which Velez grappled (sans mud) with the current political situation in the States. The idea, she explained, was “reimagining the negative stereotypes around patriotism or affiliation with, and passion and care for, a place that you call home. So we’re looking at all sorts of different allegorical female representations of national aspiration or an identity…such as Marianne from the French Revolution, or Lady Columbia, or the Statue of Liberty. But then also trying to find a way to integrate that with a more contemporary interpretation of what that girl could be—maybe she’s the cheerleader or the Miss America sort of pageant queen—and just trying to merge these two really interesting universes around womanhood and what she can symbolize to a people and to a place.”The collection takes its title, La Pucelle (The Maiden), from the pen name of Joan of Arc: Heroine, Catholic martyr, and proto-feminist, who became a symbol of France, and freedom, after the revolution. Joan might as well be a patron saint of fashion/pop culture as well; The Smiths sing about her, and she has recently returned to the catwalk care of Dilara Findikoglu and Balenciaga’s Demna. The armor is only part of her appeal; the idea of a strong, independent woman is, even in 2024, provocative. (It’s ironic that the presidential debate took place hours after Velez’s show.)', 'On learning that the conceptual points of departure for Elie Saab’s spring collection were “the sultry African air” and “sun-soaked savannah days beneath endless blue skies,” as this season’s show notes read, this reviewer will concede that they braced for what was to come. After all, while “safari chic” is a well-established fixture of the contemporary fashion vernacular—most recently and memorably revived in Anthony Vaccarello’s spring collection last year for Saint Laurent—its contemporary connotations aren’t too chic in 2024.Fortunately, what Saab showed today at the Palais de Tokyo managed to swerve the colonial nostalgia that many designers exploring similar territory have, perhaps inadvertently, previously invoked. Rather than romanticized visions of the characters one associates with the intrepid “exploration” of the African continent, here the Lebanese designer’s heart-fluttering fantasy drew upon the wealth of its myriad sublime landscapes.Okay, there were a number of riffs on safari suits—as roomy linen separates or fluid crepe jumpsuits with shrugged-up sleeves—but rather than the default khaki, they came in the hues of fireball lilies, elephant gray, and the ochre dust blown across West Africa by the Harmattan gusts. Raffia pieces were a particular standout, with the plant fiber delicately woven into low-slung skirts and long-sleeve minidresses with faint bubble hems and featuring fern embroidery on floor-grazing tulle gowns.Of course, given the source material, animalia touches were inevitable—and, really, Saab would’ve been remiss not to lean in here. Military jackets, sweeping chiffon gowns, and cinched Saharienne coatdresses were decorated in textured micro-leopard prints, though their potentially brash effect was tempered, reading more like a sultry purr than a campy roar.Foliage, too, served as a key motif throughout, with lush rainforests lending their palettes to everything from structured, belted pantsuits to wind-catching cape dresses. The most dazzling translations, however, came through decadent emerald embroideries of palm fronds on a suite of glove-fit chiffon evening gowns. Though it might be argued that this section could have been edited down, gauging by the amount of strass-y evening looks spotted in the front row, the dresses will swiftly find homes in wardrobes the moment they arrive in stores.', 'Last season, Emilia Wickstead opened a portal to her darker and more dangerous side, offering a looser, androgynous take on her signatures shown in an industrial basement. It was an impressive flexing of her muscles as a designer, and a showcase for her ability to lean more outré. But this time around, rather than simply double down on those experiments or pivot back to something more buttoned up, Wickstead wove the two threads together, reiterating the precise lines and sleek, elegant femininity you might usually associate with her, while also exploring her more provocative, tomboyish side with subtlety. It was “about following my nose and seeing where that takes me,” she said at a preview.As is often the case, Wickstead’s starting point was a specific muse: here, Gisèle Freund, the German photographer who spent decades in Paris capturing the intellectual glitterati who either lived in or passed through the city—Simone de Beauvoir, Virginia Woolf, Frida Kahlo—with a particular interest in how they worked, whether expressed through their studios, homes, or clothing. Freund was also a pioneer in the world of photojournalism, bringing modern color-photography technology to South America for the first time in the late 1930s. Hence the setting for Wickstead’s show, the hallowed halls of the Royal Geographical Society, where models wove their way around enormous explorers’ globes. “Gisèle used to say that when she would take a photograph, she could feel their souls,” Wickstead mentioned. “She had this profound relationship with her subjects, and so in this collection, I’ve tried to do the same.”One particular subject—and image—that remained front of mind for Wickstead while designing the collection was a photograph of de Beauvoir, reclining on her sofa surrounded by papers, in a peach silk shirt with a tie and matching skirt in what appears to be denim. It was this contrast that gave the designer her starting point, with riffs on the classic men’s tie that were looped under and back into the waistband, expanded into gowns with a single sheet of fabric across the chest and then tucked into an asymmetric waistline and a skirt with diagonal pleats swishing underneath.Slowly, bolder splashes of color—baby blue, sugary pastel pink, blazing green—began to creep in, as did a series of rhythmic block prints that gently nodded to mid-century Argentine design and gorgeous floral prints with a painterly bleed applied. There were gloves and headpieces by Laura Cathcart covered with glittering floral embellishments; boyish knit polo tops with contrasting black fringing on the collar; some seriously smart tailoring; and a new summer-ready riff on Wickstead’s Grenson loafers with their oversized tassels from last season, here reinterpreted as a sandal. It was eclectic but apt for the rich tapestry of characters you see while scrolling through Freund’s photos. “All of a sudden, I felt like I had created this little bit of a girl gang,” Wickstead said of putting the collection together. “I really honed in on the contrast between the public personas of the women that she photographed versus who they were at home.”As always, there was a different kind of girl gang Wickstead was thinking about too: the coterie of creative women who surround her and serve as her most loyal clients, many of whom have appeared in her look books over the years. Spending time with Wickstead herself, it’s not hard to see why so many powerful women have been charmed by her and brought closer into her orbit—she’s a natural conversationalist with the personality trait all the best designers have: a boundless curiosity. In turn, it could be why she relates to an explorer like Freund, who found her greatest inspiration in other people, then used her lens to go deeper under the skin of her subjects. It’s always a lot of fun to spend time in Wickstead’s world, but don’t underestimate the intellectual rigor of her approach to design. “What I loved most about Gisèle was that she believed photography was suited to a female mentality,” said Wickstead. “She believed that women were excellent observers, which made them better photographers.” It’s that very same point of view that helps lend Wickstead’s work its magic.', \"“Changing so as not to change” was a line in the press release. This Emporio Armani show contained several changes, including the first appearance of Emporio’s menswear studio director Nicola Lamorgese, and his womenswear equivalent Marco Brunello alongside Armani when bows were taken at the finale. Another unusual element was that we did not all troop straight out of the Teatro postshow: Instead, Armani kept it open to host a party that promised to continue long into the night. This was to mark the reopening after a six-month refurb of the big Emporio store on Via Manzoni, below the Armani Hotel.Yet another shift was that Armani delivered some quotes along with his usual thematic collection release. These, naturally, concerned change. He said: “The past 20 years have seen the progressive prevalence of digital across every sphere, and many things have changed, including consumer habits. However, I believe that physical stores provide a unique, irreplaceable, multi-sensory experience with the added value of human contact—something the virtual world lacks. A physical shop offers customers the opportunity to touch, try, and immerse themselves in the brand lifestyle. It complements the digital realm and can never be replaced by it.”Tonight’s show was Armani’s first since turning 90 in July. Next month he is due in New York to throw another show to mark the opening of a new Armani building on Madison Avenue that will contain apartments, a restaurant, and, of course, a new Giorgio Armani store. The collection we saw this evening featured menswear but nonetheless contained way over 100 looks: an expression of strength. It took a ’90s Emporio image of a female model in a suit by Tom Munro as its starting point, punctuating phases of gamine and colorful womenswear while accentuating men’s too.This brand, which opened for business in 1981 with a store on Via Durini, has always worked to connect Armani’s core codes with wider shifts in the vernacular of taste. Sporty vest dresses in kaleidoscopically shimmering horizontal stripes and some treated synthetic harnesses and parkas in washed rainbow watercolor tones were emblematic of that here. Conversely that core and Munro’s catalyst were considered in a phase of pale gray traditionally patterned suiting with breaky pants, nipped-waist jackets, and painstakingly articulated shoulders. The menswear played most notably with extreme volume, lowering jacket skirts to midthigh and using pleating and draping to engineer shape in pants sometimes wide enough for four legs to fit into. Whatever line it's cut for, Armani’s masculine suiting is enjoying a real revival at the moment as it is discovered by a new generation looking to mature out of streetwear and connect more deeply with a more elemental expression of personal style. Plus ça change…\", 'The idea of ‘masculine-feminine’ has been deployed ever since Yves Saint Laurent introduced tuxedos for women in 1966—but it’s taken till now for designers to start putting the L into LGBTQIA+ as far as visibility in fashion collections is concerned. In London, S.S. Daley started Fashion Week with his collection about the artist Gluck and Constance Spry, and Erdem’s spring offering was sketched around his research into the lives of the dandified novelist Radclyffe Hall and the sculptor Una, Lady Troubridge, who mostly wore pretty dresses“Radclyffe was most famous for writing The Well of Loneliness, which has become a kind of queer, lesbian bible of sorts,” Erdem Moralioglu related after his collection of distinctly contrasting trouser suits and arrays of drop-waisted dress silhouettes had walked the steps and courtyard of the British Museum.The title page of the The Well of Loneliness was printed on cavas and sewn as a badge of honor to the cuff of every suit—with a monocle pinned to each of the lapels. The novel was notoriously banned by the British government in 1928 for its portrayal of a female character called Stephen and her lover Mary. “Radclyffe was born Marguerite, and went by the name of John,” said Moralioglu. “What I was most interested in was how intensely she was masculine, and how feminine Una was.”He went to the Savile Row tailor Edward Sexton to get the fit of the collections’ suits correct—the results strode out in everything from pinstripes to a singularly excellent black dinner jacket. Still, Moralioglu wasn’t sticking literally to the vintage visuals. The extremely delicate dresses were gorgeous in period shades of eau-de-nil, peach and silver tissue lamé, and then many more abstract confections in deeper greens and shocking pink.Moralioglu’s repertoire extended to denim—in pale mint it treated some of his extraordinarily bedazzling sparkling crystal embroideries. Backstage, the designer was wearing a T-shirt printed with a green carnation—a secret symbol of homosexuality from Oscar Wilde’s time. He pointed out that it was being sold as part of his support for akt, the only UK charity providing support for homeless LGBTQIA+ 16-25 year olds, and Not A Phase, a trans-led grassroots charity. The persecution and suppression of queer people a hundred years ago might seem like far off history, but, Moralioglu reminded his audience, it still persists in pernicious ways today.', \"The Ermanno Scervino woman is a bon ton girl with a rebellious edge. She isn’t afraid to show her romantic side, nor to play with seduction or embrace structure, because she does it with a sense of lightness and confidence. She is ultra-feminine, but with nonchalance. “Today's woman explores the contradictions of femininity, and that’s what makes her modern. She isn’t influenced by what she wears, but rather, she uses it as a tool to highlight her personality,” said Scervino. She wears embroidered nylon bombers or suede Sahara jackets, as well as lace Sangallo slip dresses or tulle gowns adorned with sequins.Denim has always been a symbol of freedom, a statement of revolutions and pivotal changes. But in Ermanno Scervino’s spring 2025 collection, denim was not actually denim: it was an optical illusion. Silk, cotton and neoprene were printed to mimic denim’s texture, thanks to extraordinary techniques that echo couture-level craftsmanship. As a young man, Scervino wasn’t allowed to wear denim, so he found the perfect way to bring it onto the runway as prêt-à-porter. He also did this with scuba-style Montgomery jackets, tailored suits with a ’70s cut, glossy trench coats, and flowing chiffon dresses and devoré gowns with abstract floral patterns.The color palette ranged from white to black, mint green, pastel yellow, peach pink, and the signature blue of jeans. Knitwear continued to be a cornerstone of the brand's aesthetic, but in a macro-crochet version it took on a youthful character, exuding effortless chic. The attention to detail showcased how the brand’s exceptional craftsmanship has become synonymous with the freedom to experiment. The chiffon rose embroidery, found on dresses and accessories alike, reflected an impressive level of care, dedication, and refinement.\", 'On the moodboard for their spring collection, Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre pinned up a smattering of images by Helmut Newton, an “Ozempic Games” message tee, and a telling phrase: “Should I over-explain myself or remain misunderstood?” At the last minute, they titled the collection “The Elephant in the Room” and stuck one on the runway, too.Given that these days there is more than one elephant in any room at any time, hewing to a baseline of diversity and body positivity, mixed with the ultimate scandal—sex—yielded enough fodder. For inspiration, the duo pored over outraged critiques of Yves Saint Laurent’s 1971 Libération show and turned to Dr. Ruth for the soundtrack.“We’re always thinking about what to hide and what to show,” Manas offered, noting that society still considers a French size 38 (roughly an American size 8) “curvy.” Which is why she has lately taken to modeling her own brand on social media. “It’s a very trendy and sensitive topic, but that’s our elephant,” she said. “We didn’t necessarily want to talk about it; we just wanted to make clothes for everyone.”With support from the beloved French lingerie brand Chantelle, the designers sent out pretty little nothings in black lace and “naked” numbers in fine mesh designed to be layered over a new offering of basics, for example a top and leggings in coordinating leopard print. Skirts, tops and dresses busy with ruching and ruffles were likewise made for layering up by two or threes for full coverage. More elaborate pieces, like a lilac dress with 350 gathered bands applied by hand, are available by order only. Ditto the canary yellow frilled and gathered dress in look 12.Noting how their community wears teeny-tiny froncé minis like an accessory over jeans by day, the two expanded that technique to handbags. And they took a deep dive into texture, notably on printed, embossed, and bonded leather jackets that rendered the creases of the linings beneath.Summing up their process, Manas said, “It’s about a woman who’s messy-sexy, who doesn’t care about what everyone else is doing and goes out as she is.” A few coats summoned that femme fatale as well as any of the super-sheer numbers. It would be nice to see the designers take that power of suggestion and push it a little further.', 'At Etro’s show, towering cast-iron and concrete agaves in full bloom lined the center of the stage—a nod to a plant that flowers just once before producing seeds and dying. This botanical marvel, which freely grows along the Mediterranean coasts, holds deep significance for Marco De Vincenzo. “I’m from the south, and that’s where my heart belongs. Sicily is my birthplace, but I feel connected to places like Andalusia, Seville, and Greece,” he said during a preview. Though he left Sicily at a young age, he’s finding himself continuously drawn back. Agaves were a constant presence in his childhood; they’re also symbols of rebirth. When they die, they leave space for something new. It’s a metaphor for the never-ending cycle of fashion, said De Vincenzo.The spirit of the collection leaned decisively toward the south without anchoring itself to any specific geographical reference. De Vincenzo layered these influences instinctively, indulging a maximalist métissage with sexy boho undertones. He went bold—almost explosive—with bursts of saturated color, while prints were blown up into abstract floral patterns evoking a sort of psychedelic pagan symbolism. The silhouettes skimmed and sculpted the body with tight-fitting, sensual shapes—flared and sinuous, reminiscent of flamenco dancers—encrusted with lace, laminated, richly embroidered, or veiled in dark, sheer fabrics.Visually impactful, opulent, and unexpectedly sensuous and seductive by Etro’s standards, the collection felt as though it was enveloped in the powerful, almost overwhelming soundtrack performed live by Sardinian musician and singer-songwriter Daniela Pes, who mixed electronic textures with popular female vocalists and arcane lyrics drawn from ancient Gallurese phonemes.', 'Ironically, for a designer who resides in London (a city known for its gloomy and gray weather), Eudon Choi has a deep love for sunshine. Choi took a trip to Paris when designing his spring 2025 collection; he stopped by the artist Cy Twombly’s photographic exhibition and found that the two had a few things in common. “Twombly’s photography wasn’t the main focus of his work, but I was drawn into the beautiful light of his photographs,” explained Choi. “He just captured the everyday stuff like his home and work, but I loved that sensibility. Then I started to imagine what sunny weather encapsulates throughout the day from morning to dusk, and that mood was the starting point for this collection.”Twombly’s influence was present throughout the look book, not only in the way it was shot, with an emphasis on the high and low lights of the photographs, but also through the fabrications. This season, one of Choi’s hero textiles included a rayon crepe that came in both a golden yellow to represent the light and a darker slate to represent the shadows. The opening look of the collection, a dress in the charcoal fabric, featured tie detailings that started at the side of the rib cage and cascaded down toward the front for a daring yet sensual feel. Additionally, the same dress in yellow was styled with a pair of matching gauzy pants. At points where the tunic and pants briefly overlapped at the midriff, the transparency was a bit more muted, offering a different look.As an experienced tailor, Choi also brought in his craftsmanship to elevate classic pieces like utility shirts and blazers for a unique look. While for most people buttons are just tools to fasten shirts and coats, Choi used them to shape and structure his pieces. On a safari shirt, two pockets cinched the waist when buttoned but created a more A-line effect when left open. To avoid a flat effect on the shoulders, Choi added a button at the cuff to create dimension.Standout pieces also included this season’s take on tailored jackets. An earthy green jacket, upon closer inspection, featured distressed details that created what Choi called “a summer version of tweed.” And instead of using traditional buttons for this cropped jacket, the designer experimented with tie detailing. When the strands are tied, the jacket has a more feminine feel, while open it provides a fringe detailing.In his press notes, Choi mentioned that this season he sought to “encapsulate the emotional depth and lyricism of Twombly’s world, offering pieces that blend artful design with effortless wearability.” While the designer is already known for his impeccable tailoring and draping, this season he proved he could also merge his craftsmanship with an artistic take.', 'Max Schiller’s current mood is reductionist and “locavore.” It’s present in the raw denim uniforms he created for Carsten Höller’s Brutalisten restaurant in Stockholm (which operates according to a manifesto that just one ingredient is used per dish), and in a more nuanced way in the spring Eytys collection. Tired of the pervasive influence of “perfect” AI imagery, he had the lookbook shot without fanfare on an iPhone in the office and unretouched. Many of the clothes have an easy, worn-in feeling, particularly the washed Echo jeans, which are three times the size of the label’ best selling Benz jeans with a raised waist and a long, exposed button placket that is at once rustic and cool. Other denim styles are more decorative with grommet details or an expressionist patchwork of metallic threads.The origin of the leather racing jackets and “joyride” tops is as surprising as it is unexpected. Schiller went down a rabbit hole researching the Paris-Dakar Rally after learning on The Crown that Margaret Thatcher’s son Mark went missing in the Saharan desert during the 1982 race. This resulted in the addition of warm colors into a collection that was otherwise rooted in the reality of Swedish life, which is partly defined by seemingly endless winters.“What I wanted to do this season—and for all the seasons to come, I think— is start in Stockholm and create from and for life in Stockholm. The fact that we’re supposed to do clothes for life in Ibiza, it’s not our lives. I wanted the collection to reflect how we live and how we dress in the months that are internationally known as spring/summer, but [aren’t] for us.” There’s a lot to unpack here, but it seems the brand has abandoned its fascination with “Eurotrash” (the logo on a popular Eytys T-shirt in favor of some Scandi shoegazing (and weather watching).Eytys debuted as a footwear brand, and Schiller made reference to that when he made a structured blazer out of a woven raffia usually used for shoes. This is an interesting, self-aware development that has the potential to yield results that play to Eytys’ strengths, which are leather and denim plus casual separates (see the pleated khakis and shirts). While Schiller has flirted with being a capital-F fashion label, at core the brand delivers stylish pieces that make up a cool, citified uniform. In a global world the local becomes fetishized, so it would seem that the more Stockholm-ish that Eytys makes its collections, the better. There’s authenticity in a connection to place and lifestyle. If the shoe fits, wear it.', 'Before we settled in for this season’s triple-bill Fashion East runway show, there were two presentations and one open bar to enjoy. The first presentation was from newcomer Positive Energy Flows Again by footwear designer Kitty Shukman. The models sat in or around a gnarled model tree as chakra bass hummed. Some wore prosthetic angel wings or raised crucifix and wing temporary body augmentations. There was a healer in the room to ensure our energy stayed cleansed.This was Shukman’s way of shaping a contextual terrain upon which she wanted her footwear to tread. That was a slide presented in six colorways of EVA called the Infinity, which corkscrewed around the foot in an attractively WTF sculptural spiral. The highly impressive and technically challenging 3D yin-yang shoe design was evidently, as Shukman said afterward, in part the product of her spiritual practice.Upstairs and past the Bistrotheque’s heaving bar stood a happily chatting line of models wearing pieces by Sosskyn, which was represented here for the second time. Artist Samara Scott and curator Tayah Leigh Barrs created this venture together from their studio in Dover. A standout detail: One of the upcycled garments that Scott had used as a canvas for her intensely patterned reliefs in latex and other materials was a moth-eaten Loro Piana knit that had been donated by her grandmother. You could imagine Scott in the studio adding layers of texture and pattern to her wearable surfaces with as much glee and passion as she exhibited while relating that process of making.\\xa0It took a while to clear the bar, but the benches eventually filled. This was Olly Shinder’s third and final appearance on the Fashion East roster, and he signed off by showing his first-ever womenswear looks. He’d designed them over the summer, an experience of which he said: “I think it made me realize that the girl is no different from the guy.” That’s because the rules that Shinder sees and subverts are less related to gender differences than they are to an indifference to all facets of individuality that forms of uniform work to exert. By both amping up and camping up the strictures of uniform, he hands the authority of self-image back to the wearer, alongside the power to evoke archetypes of sexual fantasy. As for the future, he said: “I just want to try and have fun and make the best work that I can.”', '“Beyond” was the title of the Fashion Institute of Technology’s Master’s program show. Chosen collectively, the theme, the students wrote, “explores the limitless possibilities where creativity knows no borders. Drawing inspiration from our unique heritages, each garment transcends traditional norms, embracing fluidity in silhouette, texture, and identity.” Thirteen students participated in the show, and from look one, it was clear that this was not fashion as usual. It wasn’t just the exaggerated proportions and angular or otherwise exaggerated silhouettes, but the decentralization, in many cases, of the natural body.Up first was Bryan Barrientos’s all-white collection, and an opening gown with a full, buoyant skirt, followed by a more slender, heavily corded, leaf-like wrap. Though not at all bodycon, these garments had organic shapes. Urvi Selarka, who describes herself as a “3D artist,” created undulating sculptural body surrounds. Of particular note was a semi-sheer scalloped dress with horn-like extensions at the top of the sleeves. From Natalia Robles Oteíza there were sheer, boned “cages” worn over simple sheaths. Alongside her keep-your-distance designs were close-to-the-body dresses with fabric flowers that literally hung from threads.Fossils, rather than florals, were the starting point for their physicality and quality of preserving time and memory for Eunhae Cho’s collection, which, despite its inspiration, was quite fluid. Her button and loop closures allowed for customization. Cubist shapes defined many of Qi Yun’s pieces, yet there was also a sense of delicate movement in the overlong pant hems, the asymmetric fall of pleated fabric, and the loops falling from slashed sleeves on a sophisticated black coat. Practicing a gentler form of decon was Ziling Dong, whose line up was well-named Harmonious Collision. Soft sculpture might be the best way to describe Brunela Ramirez’s blown-up designs. Winsome was a padded, hooded coat and huge pants, a high fashion take on Frozen, perhaps? Evoking a different landscape were the lizards that were incorporated into the work of Yoon Seo Lee, including one trapped in what looked like gaffer tape over a trash bag, but which was a 3D printed belt and recycled nylon. In her bio, Lee wrote that she “finds inspiration in the overlooked details of everyday life and in the things that happen behind the scenes.” The title of her collection? Smuggler. Cindy Qianqian Dong also made use of that new technology to craft the looks in her lineup that looked like jewelry-garment hybrids as they featured bold silver “jewels” supported by invisible string and satin and chiffon bodices.', 'Those who’ve spent much time on the British Isles this summer will know that it has been—perhaps unsurprisingly—a total washout. Among them is Feben, who took the constant rain as a point of departure for her namesake label’s latest collection, titled Reign. “It was a play on words,” the designer explained backstage post-show, acknowledging the terrible weather we’ve been blighted with, but also the possibility of putting positive spins on seemingly negative situations.A key figure of inspiration in this endeavour was Antonia Singla, the legendary flamenco dancer and actress. Despite the inhibitions imposed by her lifelong deafness, she rose to become one of the dance form’s true greats. “She’s someone that transformed their vulnerability into a strength,” Feben said. “She would literally feel the beat from the music, and tap it out with her feet.” The inspiration expressed itself most directly through blotched v-neck and single-strapped white cotton dresses, both featuring dropped waists and flounced hems that swished with sass as the models walked. Heavily fronded jersey dresses and separates were made to be moved in with gusto—as if a wild turn on the dancefloor were the only way to truly bring them to life. A little less dressy, but no less distinct, were a selection of cinched shirts born of a collaboration with OnceMore, a Swedish textile developer that creates fabric from regenerated wood pulp.Elsewhere, rich textures—a cornerstone of Feben’s design vocabulary—featured prominently, with velvet riffs on the designer’s ‘Twist’ technique confidently building on her initial experiments in the fabric last season. A longstanding partnership with a community of artisanal beaders in Accra, Ghana yielded a netted bateau-neck column dress trimmed with ostrich feathers—“there’s sense of armor to it, but the wearer’s also exposed—it embodies the juxtaposition at the heart of the collection,” Feben said. The most intriguing developments on show, though, were the split-seamed skirts and vest dresses with sculpted hips, richly embroidered with reversible sequins. “I thought it would be really nice to introduce pieces that change with touch,” Feben said. Pieces that you can tweak to match your mood, whatever the weather.', 'Modernity and maternity have intertwined across time at Fendi to beget a form of fashion eternity—or at least 100 years of it so far and counting. For this first womenswear Fendi season of its centennial year, Kim Jones both considered and collaborated with the four generations of women who have shaped its course.Over the sound system, we heard Silvia Venturini Fendi discussing the house and the nature of beauty and fashion with her mother, Anna. It was Anna’s mother, Adele, who opened the first Fendi shop in the Eternal City back in 1925. And it is Adele’s great-granddaughter, Delfina, who Jones has cited as his central Fendi muse during his time here. Today, as is customary, Delfina had designed the jewelry and Silvia the accessories.Jones is a masterful editor—he has to be, to handle all the collections on his plate—and here he combined that attribute with his core design métier to present a collection that spanned Fendi’s century. What kept it cohesive was the combination of house craft, color, and an attitude that stemmed from the disruptive jazz-age modernism—the first rock and roll—of the 1920s.We started and finished with a series of gauzy drop-waist dresses embroidered with Art Deco graphics or pearl-edged botanical reliefs. Although there was the occasional fringed hem, these were no nu-flapper period pieces: Jones minimized the silhouettes and updated the necklines in a manner that made them echo ’90s slip dresses or even sportswear hybrids.Between these foundational bookends, Jones roamed freely, mixing beige shearling robes, white crocodile suede T-shirts and skirts, and a mesh vest edged and waisted with house-ochre Cuoio Romano. The collection included an extremely fine (and hopefully menswear-encompassing) collaboration with heritage U.S. boot maker Red Wing. The resulting Selleria-stitched moccasin work boots emphasized the history of family feminine industry Jones was celebrating, but also, when worn with ruffled floral socks and clematis- and jasmine-pattern tea dresses, delivered unmissable grunge overtones.Fendi’s 1990s moment of commercial nirvana was further explored in a series of tactile and boho iterations of the Baguette, which were sometimes fringed and amplified in volume. These were heaped with curios, charms, and jewelry, including furry bouquets and ruffle-edged earbud cases.Today, Jones was exploring the contradictory nature of what’s “modern”—its constant permanence and impermanence—through his decorative references to different phases of fashion and also to a line of women all different but inherently connected. While Adele was responsible for Fendi’s conception, it was her daughters Anna, Alda, Paola, Carla, and Franca who first propelled Fendi into international renown. Over the PA, we heard Anna recall: “Our mother always said, ‘You are like a hand. There are five of you, the fingers. They are different from each other; they are complementary to each other.’” When you hear any mention of DNA in a fashion or luxury context, it tends to be marketing rhetoric—not at Fendi.', \"There are nearly 15,000 shoe designs in the Ferragamo archive of work by its founder, Salvatore. And, said Maximilian Davis today: “all of them were created for a reason, and all of them contain a story.”The stories he zeroed in on this season related to dance. The moodboard featured a 1950 shot of Salvatore fitting footwear on Katharine Dunham, the American dancer and choreographer whose art was influenced by her ethnographic research in the Caribbean: “There were a lot of things I felt connected to,” said Davis of Dunham. Added to that were images of Nureyev (who apparently danced in Ferragamo shoes) and some Mapplethorpe-ian ballet photographs by Hans van Manen. The final twist was a reference to the canvases (not cans) of artist Piero Manzoni: Davis said he was drawn to the tactility and texture of Manzoni's surfaces.Cue curtain up. Loose trench coats with sub-butt belting, field jackets and sectioned skirts were cut in metal-spiked nylon give that crunchy Manzoni feel and emanated that ’80s off-duty ballet hunk vibe that Nureyev so powerfully emanated—this was further transmitted in a great, butch oversized black leather pea coat. Leggings, bodies, and ribboned pointed-toe pumps were worn with double wrapped tops that mirrored the classic ballet cardigan. These telegraphed Davis’s design leap to a section of silk-mix block color sportswear looks that featured double-wrapped jackets and silk knit dresses with ribbed hems thrown into unorthodox shapes through knotting and drape.Full parachute dresses billowed against the wearer obscured physical form as much as it was mapped and accentuated by fitted knit dresses inset with striped organic shapes that looped as fringe below and back into the hemline. Bags, shorts and asymmetrically defined fitted dresses and skirts in washed denim were edged with an emphatic spray of tufted fringing. The house codes were reinforced in outerwear and a skirt cut from leather Gancini mesh.\", 'This seventh Ferrari fashion collection signaled a shift in gear from Rocco Iannone. There were fewer pieces that seemed designed solely to make an impact on the runway and more conceived for a real-life end user. That person, as Iannone sees it, is pretty specific. Around the world, there are more than 13,000 men and women who are members of official Ferrari owners’ clubs. Iannone said that he and his team had spent time investigating the wants and needs of these and other Ferrari-philes, and reported that at a Ferrari community gala held during the Miami Grand Prix this year, an exclusive colorway, jewel-covered example of one of his bodywork-shaped clutch bags sold at auction for more than $100,000. He said, “It is very interesting to understand how much they are into craftsmanship. They want a wardrobe that is concrete, wearable, and in which the proportions and volumes are very well defined.”Appropriately, Iannone was in a hurry this morning and couldn’t speak for long. However, the opening and perhaps overlong section of bronze-brown tailoring and racily unfussy dresses and sports separates in leather and silky jersey seemed a reference to the gorgeous and same-color vintage Ferrari parked on the sidewalk outside. The pieces you could see that Miami Ferrari fan club snapping up at a fast and furious pace included the upholstery-soft leather jumpsuits, bikers, and skirts in a lustrous nutty brown, as well as a khaki treated cotton and green fluoro technical fabric. A tight section of breezy foulard outfits crafted in a retro aerodynamic print and a full skirt in the marque’s famous red were accented with some oversized driving goggle sunglasses. The closing trio of looks, cut in a mesh of interlinked embroidered prancing horses, were for the most committed fans of all.', 'Personnel changes at Filippa K mean that the spring collection started by Liisa Kessler was completed by the in-house team with input from the new creative lead, Anna Teurnell, who will also continue to run her tiny, mighty namesake label, Teurn Studios. Both brands tend toward the minimal, but by the looks of it, at Filippa K the designer is working toward a modular simplicity that builds sturdy bridges between the house’s dependable basics (such as fine gauge knits and denim) and its more fashion forward proposals.In contrast to Teurnell’s own three-year-old line, Filippa K has a long history, having been founded in 1993 by Filippa Knutsson to offer an effortlessly cool uniform for working women like herself. (Menswear followed in 1998. The brand was early on the wellness bandwagon, launching the now shuttered Soft Sport line in 2011.) Teurnell said that the fact that Filippa K has its own DNA will allow her to “use the past to go forward.” Yet part of what made this collection compelling is how Teurnell has made things personal by referencing her own experiences with the brand, iterating on her own first Filippa K purchases, including stretch denim. See Look 12, a pair of leg-lengthening jeans with a slight flare that skims the ground when worn with kitten heels and covers the foot if worn with flats, paired with an impeccable black leather blazer.As Filippa K has always been associated with work, tailoring is key. Teurnell has a special gift for tweaking proportions, and she brought in the waist on the opening look, a women’s pantsuit, and narrowed the shoulders on men’s suiting. The team’s preference is to pair suits with soft knits and loafers. More casual styles were shown with almost-preppy button downs and collared sweaters. More daring were city shorts, but this editor’s money is on the outwear, like Look 4, a nylon gabardine car coat with an embroidered logo monogram, or Look 30, a citified A-line jacket with patch pockets and side snaps that allow it to be worn open, a detail Kessler found in the archive that Teurnell will continue to develop. If there was something almost Langian about the styling and the pared back set, it’s probably because Filippa K’s heyday was also the ’90s. And there is a sense that these are clothes that work for and with you. Teurnell, who said she aims to “take back this sort of attractive wearability, the elevated wardrobe, the products that you need and come back to,” didn’t originate this collection, but her mark is clearly on it, making Filippa K’s future look bright.', 'To mark FRS’s 10th anniversary, Francesca Ruffini went for a personal approach. Typically reserved and discreet, she set aside her usual self-effacing manner for a touch of self-indulgence. “I wanted to give myself a gift,” she remarked during a presentation at her stunning villa with views of Lake Como.Ruffini carefully chose pieces from her extensive personal archive that held sentimental value, selecting only the items she had worn frequently and associated with joyful memories. She named the curated 30-piece collection “Only Francesca’s Favorites” and opted to present it in only two colors: a deep red and a radiant white. “Red represents the passion I put into my work, while white is the color I love the most, symbolizing simplicity, purity, and integrity,” she explained.FRS’s repertoire of masculine pajamas, fluid long chemises, and robes de chambre was re-energized with a tight edit, and the limited color palette gave it more presence and allure.While Ruffini’s personal style typically embraces chic, comfortable versatility, she introduced a touch of drama with long, statement-making capes crafted from terry cloth and lined with cotton. Draped over sleek tunics or double-breasted soft pajama suits, they exuded a glamour that Ruffini, despite her unassuming demeanor, clearly enjoys.', 'It’s not uncommon to leave a fashion show thinking, That was nice, but who can wear those clothes? And who is going to buy them? No one leaves a Frederick Anderson show thinking that, though. Partly because his collections are so clearly conceived with his well-heeled, well-traveled, women-about-town clients in mind, but also because those clients are a striking presence in his front row—swapping air kisses and summer vacation tales before taking their seats. Such was the scene when Anderson presented his spring collection at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music.There, models walked the runway in looks heavily inspired by Anderson’s many trips to North Africa, namely Marrakech and Tangier. “Even though my clients are destination clients, I do like to take them on adventures and try to teach them a little bit,” Anderson said the day before at his Flatiron boutique and studio. The first lesson was in robe dressing and the region’s “heritage of ease”: light-as-a-feather Egyptian linen employed for a trench and wide-leg trousers, a cream duster in Anderson’s signature crochet. “This is a fabric that would be in North Africa in the market,” he explained of a striped, multicolored jacquard, “but I reinvented it in Italy to make it a little bit softer and lighter so that it’s a garment fabric as opposed to a tapestry fabric.” Anderson made delightful use of it for Look 11, an overcoat and matching front-pocket shorts.“You start off with this lightness, and then we get into this glamour, which I love,” Anderson explained. Those designs include a dazzling beaded vest and capelet combo (a collaboration with wearable art designer Colette Harmon) and a sexy red leopard-print dress with sequined and leather details. Black lace dresses with fringe and feathers would be fit for a desert party that’ll go on until daybreak.Beyond reflecting on his travels, Anderson is keen on his collections embracing various cultures—especially during a time in America when “we’re not embracing anyone,” he said. “We keep talking about ourselves and we forget that there’s a globe.” His spring offering was an apt and sophisticated reminder.', 'A year ago at this time, Gabriela Hearst was dancing on the Seine with models and members of the Mangueira samba school of Brazil. It was a last hurrah at Chloé, where she spent three years as creative director, leading the French house on an eco-minded journey. While she was there the Richemont-owned brand achieved B Corp status. Today she was back on the Left Bank with her eponymous collection, talking a similar earth-first language and making connections between goddess worship, reverence for Mother Nature, and respect for women.Her show notes were several pages long, with descriptions of looks and the goddesses that inspired them. Leather capes slightly longer in the back than the front were attributed to Diana, the same goddess that Maria Grazia Chiuri was thinking about this season, as it happens. Hecate, the protector goddess and a close associate of Diana in the myths, was a model for the chain closure on a sharply tailored black blazer, while the metal-woven silk used for both a pantsuit and a puff-sleeve dress nodded at Fides, the goddess of faith and trust.Hearst was earnest when she said she believed in the power of prayer. “This is an invocation,” she declared at a preview. But without the press release, there was nothing to give away her muses. The slinky knits, strong tailoring, and romantic dresses are all signatures she’s been refining over the decade since she launched her label. That said, she’s been investing in materials, like the mulberry silk of subtly luxurious hand knits. And she’s also been pushing at the edges, cutting a leather coat and pants with cowboy swagger and launching some truly excellent cowboy boots.The Gabriela Hearst brand is in growth mode, with two stores opening in Japan before the end of the year. Being here in Paris, she could count on the attention of international press and buyers who aren’t making the trip to New York Fashion Week as regularly as they have in the past. She chose the garden of the Hotel Pozzo di Borgo, otherwise known as Karl Lagerfeld’s backyard. That’s a lot to live up to. For the occasion she designed her first high jewelry, and it included a necklace of black silk cord, from which she suspended both a tension-set imperial-jade pendant and a pavé of eight baguette diamonds.', 'Ganni’s Paris debut was 15 years in the making. In 2009 Ditte and Nicolaj Reffstrup took the reins of the Danish contemporary brand and, with a small local team, started building the company into the household name it is today. The Ganni Girl concept, which is centered on a colorful and fun-loving approach to fashion (rather than gender) captured the world’s imagination; as the business has expanded globally, the team has become increasingly international. Ganni now operates between Copenhagen and Paris, where its new CEO, Balenciaga alum Laura du Rusquec, is based. When Ganni, once the anchor of Fashion Week in Copenhagen, stepped back from shows two seasons ago, the rumor mill had it that this move was imminent, and so it was.Why Ganni in Paris is news is less to do with location than with market placement. The French capital is ground zero for luxury, it’s the birthplace of the great maisons (which for so long were resistant to ready-to-wear). Ganni is not a luxury brand: “we are not trying to be someone, we are not trying to play a luxury game,” Ditte Reffstrup stated on a walk through and the show proved she meant what she said. Danes are famously home-loving, and it felt as if the upbeat, welcoming Ganni spirit had been imported to France, especially when the models came out smiling and holding hands at the end of the show.The thing is, Reffstrup explained, brands evolve, just like people do. “It felt like we were ready to do something new, and because we’re expanding globally, it kind of made sense. Of course it’s a dream for everyone to come to Paris, it is like the mother of fashion, it is the big scene, and it’s obviously super scary,” she continued. “We are used to being one of the bigger fish and now we are just a tiny one; it’s a different energy, it’s almost going back to a startup energy.” Being a proven success, Ganni is in the place to help others become big fish. In the two seasons it stepped away from the runway, the company has supported local talent back home. Building on that, for spring, Ganni invited Nicklas Skovgaard, a Dane known for his ebullient bubble silhouettes, and Claire Sullivan, a New York-designer with a penchant for tulle an tutu-like volumes, based in New York, to participate in a creative consultancy. Their task was to design garments, using materials from Ganni’s Fabrics of the Future sustainability initiative, that will go into limited production. Skovgaard and Sullivan watched from the front row as their creations. These included a mocha-colored party dress of OleatexTM, a material made using Biotex, which is derived from olive oil production waste in Turkey (his); and cleverly patterned pieces featuring sport jerseys of Cycora, a polyester material made directly from textile waste (hers). These designer consultancy looks were fully integrated into the collection, rather than set apart, eliminating any sense of virtue signaling.', 'A go-to among minimalists since the brand was founded a decade ago, Gauchere this season stepped away from the runway, instead staging its spring collection in its airy Haussmannian showroom opposite the Louvre.It was a smart move, not least because the season’s inspiration was vibrations and electricity, or as designer Marie-Christine Statz put it, “A tremor with varying degrees of intensity, with a mix of materials so the movement happens within the pieces.” Given the incremental details, in person was the best possible format for unexpected pairings and silhouettes that explored larger volumes within smaller ones and twist effects not shown here. The designer described it as “two tectonic plates colliding and creating a twist between both layers.”A case in point was a simple-looking white tank topstitched to its black tulle overlayer, which Statz called “two pieces living together on the body in a different way.” Suiting, one of the brand’s strengths, offered up a color-blocked proposition in a mix of khaki, white, and black. Semitransparent nylons kept company with silk and cotton fabric shot through with metallic fibers that created a deliberately wrinkled effect. For evening, dresses in jersey, such as in Look 11, rose to the occasion. Linen separates, graphic pairings, mesh, and transparency with leather or coated fabrics neatly blended romance and strength.', 'It has been two years since Jenny Cheng and Esther Gauntlett showed a collection during New York Fashion Week; but they had good reason for their comeback this year—it was their brand’s 10th anniversary. “We wanted to celebrate our 10 years as a New York brand but also to celebrate each other,” Cheng said a week after their show at their showroom in Soho. “It’s an important marker of time and a chance to reflect.” In 2020 the brand had decided to show only once a year, but they attributed their most recent extra-long break to needing “space.” “We wanted to make sure this season was the celebration we were both craving,” Gauntlett added. “We’re really passionate about making sure Gauntlett Cheng has longevity; that we enjoy making the collections, that we have time and space to do so, and that we support each other and our mental health.”If space was what they needed then it’s a good thing they got it; their spring 2025 collection was their strongest yet. The opening look was a halter top and matching skirt made from Japanese mohair mixed with a metallic yarn knitted into “ottoman knit with floats” so that the horizontal yarns sort of floated above the rest of the fabric. But look closer, and it was in fact a dress; the top and bottom pieces were joined by a mesh bodice. This same interplay with negative space was used on a pencil skirt where the mesh panels “surrounded” curved panels on the front and back of the skirt, exposing the hips and sides of the legs as the models walked. The designers also inverted this effect on a pair of trousers and a skirt made from white lace, turned inside out, and overprinted with a “tweed pattern.” The lace was contrasted by a fabric embellished with teeny tiny sequins, which outlined the sheer panels on the middle. The same “tweed pattern” was printed on an easy-yet-elegant bias-cut slip dress adorned with a hand-beaded asymmetrical panel that could be worn in different ways around the body.“We make all the samples in house, our hands are touching everything, and it was important to us to give ourselves time to play and to really push all those kinds of textile manipulations,” said Gauntlett. A few pieces embellished with a myriad of sequins, golden stars, rhinestones, and other bits and bobs they’d sourced from the Dance Theater of Harlem a decade ago were made in collaboration with David Moses—who was the third designer when they first launched as Moses Gauntlett Cheng. “When we were thinking about how we wanted to work with David again, the idea of ‘making together’ was really important,” said Gauntlett. “We wanted to sit down, the three of us, our hands all on something.”Elsewhere, they hand cut a sparkly tinsel-y knit to turn it into a stripe-on-sheer fabric, which they used—once again inside out—on a series of asymmetrical draped tops and dresses. Against the skin, the tinsel becomes “trapped underneath the skin,” adding a different textural element. Their signature ruched elastic draped asymmetric dresses and tops were modern, ladylike, and further proof of how far they’ve come. “This is the most complicated pattern I’ve ever done in my life!” Gauntlett added. “It’s one big spiral that wraps around the body, and all these lines are [angled] at 72 degrees exactly, and they continuously spiral around the body.”', 'To the exuberant sound of a special remix of “Everything is Romantic,” made for the show by Charli XCX herself, Giuliano Calza presented his spring 2025 collection, “Flowers of the Concrete.” The show location was the Italian stock exchange palace, best known for the “L.O.V.E.” sculpture of a raised middle finger by Maurizio Cattelan placed in front of it. Delicate flowers capable of blossoming in harsh conditions were a metaphor to represent the resilient women embodied by contemporary pop artists and icons who constantly influence the world around us and are a crucial inspiration (almost an obsession) for Calza. Charli XCX, of course, but also Bianca Censori, said Calza during a preview in his office. The “stubborn energy” of these women, as Calza put it, ignited a reflection on how niches evolve to become, sometimes, globally accepted.All that was the starting point for a collection Calza wanted his community to feel. So there were pieces fans could easily replicate at home, like the V-shaped elasticated tops often obtained from already existing T-shirts, or sheer knitwear and tights used as colorful, hyper-pop bodysuits. These proposals were paired—with the idea of creating an evident contrast—to duchesse satin pieces and sartorial creations, such as pencil skirts, bombers, and mini dresses of vaporous silhouettes. This contrast, also present in the color palette (a juxtaposition of bright tones from orange to purple) was further explored through multiple shades of green, including “Brat green,” of course.Calza’s pop exploration and reinterpretation was once again a central theme, but in a more subtle way. An example was his signature Hello Kitty bikini, this time in a yellow version, which timidly peeked out from the geometric neckline of a mini dress.', '“I’ve named this collection Very Valli because, in a time of global uncertainty—politics, the economy, the climate—I felt the need to turn inward, seeking clarity within myself,” said Giambattista Valli before today’s show. His mood board featured quotes he penned, a sort of manifesto of his guiding principles: “The weight of lightness,” “The past is for culture, not for nostalgia,” “A look is a silent statement,” “Age is a mental posture.”How can fashion help alleviate the world’s current distress? Valli said that this question weighs on him daily. “We are privileged to do what we do,” he said. “Our responsibility is to remain grounded in reality while also conveying a sense of beauty and lightness. Although it may seem oxymoronic to say that lightness has a weight, these two opposing concepts need each other. Reality and dream, depth and levity.”The collection read as a conversation between those conflicting energies. Slender silhouettes played against billowing forms; short hemlines alternated with ankle-grazing lengths, and flat ballerinas coexisted alongside stilettos. Valli crafted his signature couture shapes—cocoon-draped dresses, short cocktail pieces with poufed skirts, and ball gowns with undulating trapeze skirts—using poplin, cotton organza, and jersey, keeping them unstructured, light, and dynamic. These same simple fabrics were also turned into the fluttering feathers beneath the ruched peplums of bodices, the rosettes embellishing necklines, and the floral-fringed hems of abbreviated tunics.For the finale, Valli offered a series of flowy, draped mousseline dresses in fresh sherbet hues; they looked flattering, vital, and individual. “The women I design for aren’t paradoxes or clones but personalities with independent minds and distinct tastes, engaged in today’s reality,” he said. “They don’t need fictitious narratives, nor to be the parody of someone else. I feel privileged to be at their service.”', '“What I love most about New York is its speed, its constant reinvention, and its ability to remain both itself and entirely different,” Giorgio Armani told Vogue before his show tonight. He might as well have been describing himself. The 90 year-old showed 90 looks that gave us a dizzyingly broad overview of the many territories Armani has explored during his 49 years in business, yet which also felt fresh: this was more than some reverent retrospective.The ostensible reason Armani was in New York for his first-ever mainline show outside of Milan— and his first show here since 2013’s One Night Only—was to herald the reopening of his store (and restaurant, and apartments) on Madison Avenue. At the pre-show schmooze the news was that this store has been taking north of $1 million a day in its first three days so far. But beyond that reason, this show was long overdue: between 1975 and 1982 Armani’s ascent from obscure start-up to become the world’s hottest fashion designers was inextricably linked to the passion he inspired here. Second only to Milan, New York was the key launchpad for his global success. As he said of his earliest visits: “Experiencing it for the first time in the late 1970s after only having seen it on the screen was stimulating. It was an exciting time for both the city and America, and I felt like I was part of it.”\\xa0Mid-schmooze, it was the arrival of two steam trains projected onto the walls of the Park Avenue Armory that signaled this evening’s show was ready to go. A curtain dropped to reveal a huge showspace set with semi-circle banquette seating. We gradually settled into Armani’s fantasy waiting room to watch a show that unfolded a little like the Grand Central Station scene in North by Northwest.The first passenger to stride past wore a cropped trench and full pleated pants tucked into mid-calf boots. She was shadowed by a luggage-lugging porter but also carried a greige leather pochette clipped to her belt and a clutch tucked under her arm. After her appeared several other characters who were precisely delineated by props or styling: these included the flustered hero in greige tailoring whose knitted tie had blown over his unstructured right shoulder, and the uptown princess in blush silk bloomers and jacket dress, also in blush, that nicely complemented the handsome labradoodle-meets-cockapoo dog she held in the crook of one arm.\\xa0', 'Giovanna Flores has an instinctual approach to clothes that is informed and influenced by not only the materials but the process of designing and sewing. She works mostly with deadstock fabrics and vintage garments, and also with the “scraps” that are the natural by-product of making clothes, utilizing a technique she calls “blind fitting,” which she described a few years ago as using darts and seams without representation of the body, and then placing them on the body to fit them. Last season, she held a fashion show at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery as part of the exhibition “The New Village: Ten Years of New York Fashion.” “It felt very scrappy to me, like, literally, the scraps were coming out of the seams and sort of out of the body,” she recalled at her Brooklyn apartment, which doubles as her studio. One of the highlights of that collection was a sheer\\xa0long-sleeve top with bits of different colored fabric popping out of the shoulder and side seams, outlining the body in color instead of covering it. “I’m always developing collections until the last minute, and always at the end, I feel like I start to come up with new ideas, and then I’m like, ‘Shoot, I have to hold these for next time,’” she said.And so where last season the scraps felt like their own little universe, this season they returned to the body, cinching and encircling it. A pink minidress got its form via diamond-shaped darts that were shown inside out, while bits of fabric that seemed to overflow from the waistbands of skirts and the necklines of tops and dresses were a bit of a happy accident. “I wanted these clean-finished edges, so I thought I would use the scraps as the facing,” Flores explained. “Originally, the scraps were meant to be on the inside, but then as I flipped them, I thought, Oh, maybe that’s just what’s nice about it.” On a white skirt, the pink and patterned pieces gave the illusion of a slightly deconstructed peplum. It was paired with a black halter top pieced together from irregular shaped bits of fabric; across the bust the fabric had been replaced with a fringed “patch” made from thin hand-cut tubes of jersey. It had an undone kind of elegance about it. This jersey fringe added interesting movement and texture to many other pieces—looping from the shoulder of a white tank top, gathered into a bikini top, and added as an embellishment on colorful tights that then peeked out from underneath dresses. Flores’s take on dresses is always charming—a few in a light-as-air floral cotton voile pieced together with a more robust white and blue cotton; a yellow silk slip dress with contrasting jersey triangular insets made from vintage T-shirts at the chest. An easy pink sheath had two feathers below the breasts, as if the dress had been pinched with fingers and somehow kept its shape. Flores said: “To me, it feels like developing film, where you don’t really know what it’s going to be, and then you put it on, and it’s like, ‘Oh, this is great.’”', 'Though Grace Ling is one of New York’s next up-and-coming designers (she’s a finalist for this year’s CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund), she’s already a familiar face to the stars in Hollywood. At just 27, her sensual and surrealist designs are favorites among an A-list celebrity crowd including Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and Anya Taylor-Joy. Ling’s Gen-Z knack for experimenting beyond traditional design by pushing boundaries with 3D printing and CGI is solidifying her as a force to be reckoned with. These days, her customer base is rapidly growing; her ready-to-wear pieces are sold at most big retailers, including Nordstrom, Net-a-Porter, and Bergdorf Goodman; and this year, Ling has even started to receive requests from couture clients for one-of-a-kind pieces.“This year, we started to do a lot of couture looks, so for those clients, I wanted to push it at today’s show,” said Ling. Her opening look, worn by Alex Consani, featured one of the brand’s signature 3D-printed aluminum breastplates, except this time broken in a Neanderthal manner, fitting for the collection also titled Neanderthal. Against the silent runway and smoke machine, as Consani walked down the runway, you could hear the subtle clacks of metal clicking against the cement floors, giving the guests a four-dimensional experience of beautiful clothes and euphonious sounds.Beyond pushing her boundaries to create couture looks, Ling experimented with new color palettes unfamiliar to her world, including blood red, leaf green, and rust brown. This season, a lapel-less blazer and pant set joined her collection, which stuck with the rose concept the designer referenced throughout. Like a drooping flower, her jackets and pants started straight and rigid like the stem, but bloomed as they reached the bottom into a blossoming bud.', 'Armor might not be the first word one would use to describe Greta Constantine’s colorful spring collection—but it’s what designer Kirk Pickersgill had in mind when creating his new offering of upbeat formalwear. “When you think of the word armor, you think of clothes that are there to protect you,” he says. “But when women go out, the clothing they put on is also the number one thing they want to be seen in. It gives you that air of confidence.”His sculptural gowns are certainly created with the intention of being noticed. Focusing on his luxe materials—silks, satins, bardos—Pickersgill drew inspiration from glamorous figures like Diana Vreeland and Roxie Roker for his spring shapes, creating dresses meant to make an entrance at a party. (Many of his clientele buy his pieces for important galas.) “They were amazing style icons,” Pickersgill said of his seasonal muses. “[Roxie] used to wear clothes that had volume—not in a robust way but in the amount of fabric used.”The designer aimed to create pieces that commanded space without quite literally being exaggerated in proportion. Take his purple strapless gown, ruched at the knees to give it an hourglass shape, or his black off-the-shoulder dress with a sculptural wavy neckline. These pieces had just the right amount of drama, though elsewhere Pickersgill couldn’t help himself from getting carried away—his tiered ruffle minidress in salmon pink was a frock worthy of a modern-day Marie Antoinette.His bright, zingy colors worked best on more refined silhouettes, like the streamlined long-sleeve jumpsuit in lemon yellow. The designer also toyed with texture, adding three-dimensional flower petals to jersey maxidresses, either on the neckline or as trim. Florals? For spring? Maybe not groundbreaking, but they were perfectly pretty nonetheless.', 'When Fiordaliso’s 1986 hit “Non Voglio Mica La Luna” kicked in as the models walked their finale lap at Gucci today, the crowd started bopping in their seats and singing along. Sabato De Sarno’s first year at this brand hasn’t always been easy, but he set out to put a sunny, happy spin on things with his new show.His first step was returning to La Triennale, Milan’s museum of art and design and the site of his June men’s show, staging a sort of sunset in the round, with successive rooms in the oblong space shading from yellow to orange to Ancora red. At a preview earlier this week De Sarno talked fondly about his August holidays, spent with his husband and parents in Formentera—the set was designed to capture that endless summer feeling.His muse was Jackie O, a Gucci client way back when and global style icon to this day, one who’s inspired countless designers over the decades. “When I made my research in the archive I found someone describe her style as ‘casual grandeur.’ These words stayed with me for my creative period,” he explained. The Kennedy clan is freshly relevant—Ryan Murphy just announced he’s producing a new TV show about John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy—so the Jackie link was a bit of synchronicity.The reference wasn’t obvious from the opening look, a wool bomber paired with hip-slung slouchy trousers (previously seen in his spring collection for men) and sneakers, but as the show progressed, the archival print headscarves and big sunglasses suggested De Sarno was vibing on Jackie’s Capri era. A woven raffia coat in fluoro green with a barely perceptible floral print and printed seaside separates with matching wide-brimmed sun hats—these patterns inspired by a photo of Queen Elizabeth II in Gucci—were designed to channel the jet-set style of the ’60s.For the celebrity contingent—Kirsten Dunst, Dakota Johnson, Daisy Edgar-Jones, and the like—there was a red carpet-friendly mirror sequin sleeveless dress. Elsewhere De Sarno riffed on the iconic white jersey dresses of Tom Ford’s fall 1996 collection, only his were in deep colors and draped from gold bamboo-shaped arm bands and chokers. The Bamboo bag was the company’s big push this season. There were a number of vintage versions customized by Japanese artists in the show, and a press release made special note of an exhibition currently running in Japan showcasing the bag’s 60-year history in that country. A shoulder strap bucket bag that also appeared frequently had horsebit detailing, which was seen, too, on new flat boots, an evolution of the brand’s familiar loafers.The show culminated in a group of looks with the jet-set spirit of today: oversize coats whose hems scraped the floor worn with tanks and boyish jeans. These might’ve represented De Sarno’s biggest advance: an elusive casual attitude that he hasn’t quite nailed before. A gloom has set in at Gucci, but watching the dancing and singing along to that old Fiordaliso song, it seemed that De Sarno had found himself some new fans. That’s a step forward, perception being such a crucial element of success.', 'Since relaunching his eponymous line in 2021, Charles Harbison has unapologetically honed his flair for the dramatic. His signature gowns are designed in the brightest blues and most shocking pinks, marked by exaggerated proportions, floral embellishments, and the addition of billowy capes because… why not?“So many of my clients want absurdity,” Harbison said during a studio visit in New York. “They’re like, ‘I want a longer train! I want a bigger sleeve!” For spring 2025, the LA-based designer delivered with short dresses and A-line mini skirts affixed with oversized satin rosettes; a voluminous bolero jacket that can also be also be worn as a top, draped across the chest; and vibrant, body-hugging, fit-for-a-ball gowns. Harbison made some of these pieces in white—ideal for the more-is-more bride. The offering extends beyond fantasy dressing, though, with much of the collection rooted in Harbison’s version of practicality.“I’ve been in this Boticelli, Venetian, sort of opulent space,” he explained, adding that he also drew inspiration from the work of painter Danielle McKinney. The combination of the two—a past version of obvious perfection and a modern version of what Harbison describes as McKinney’s “heady, intellectual perfection”—resulted in long pleated skirts, two-tone shirt dresses, and breezy, oversized pajama sets, all in washed silk and neutral hues. “I know I have a knack for bold color, and I love primaries,” Harbison says, “but when I was looking at the inspiration—and I really do use my inspo boards, because they push me—the Botticelli world requires you to see beauty in a pastel, muted, hazy dream world sort of vibe.” A North Carolina native who often designs with his mother and aunts in mind, his references were apparent in a halterneck maxi dress in black and gold that floated under one of his sweeping overcoats. “Very, very Black excellence,” he said of the look.While eveningwear continues to shine bright in the Harbison universe, spring 2025, the designer said, allows the women he designs for “to proceed in their daytime with that same kind of audacity; that same kind of absurdity, optimism, and glitz. There’s no reason why that can’t be part of your daytime.”', 'Seven months ago, Harris Reed began setting alerts on second-hand resale sites online, from Depop to Etsy, and eBay to Textile Trunk, in a bid to source vintage interiors fabrics for his spring 2025 collection. His search for materials—including an Art Nouveau lace appliqué drape, a 19th century cherub-motif golden silk damask that once upholstered a headboard, and confectionery-hued striped vintage curtain panels in duchesse satin—took his small team from British car boots to specialist online sellers across Europe as he “got the itch” for sourcing far and wide. Reed’s inspirations are usually rooted in a storytelling narrative—like paper dolls, debutante balls, and Shakespearean costume—but this season he let fabrication fuel his collection concept. While you wouldn’t expect it of his ostentatious designs, he said, “I love working within limitations.”Reed took these design cues from his fall 2024 collaboration with wallcovering specialist Fromental—who provided him with scraps of hand-painted silk wallpaper—and the experience of decorating the new London home he moved into in July. “I went very maximalist and regal with tons of velvet, and reupholstered lots of things,” he said. “I almost wanted the pieces in this collection to stand up on their own like furniture.” Take a fishtail bias-cut skirt and jacket, featuring a structured lapel that swoops like a headpiece around the body, crafted using three 200-year-old Point de Venise lace tablecloths and shawls, color-matched and crocheted together. Or a white silk organza mini-dress, appliqued with black 3D flowers made from old haberdashery fabrics, with dramatic hip panniers, that resemble “the arms of chair.” For Reed’s evolving client list in Texas (in addition to a strong custom-order market in Asia and the Middle East), the bolder the design, the better. “The more we push maximalism and over-the-top elegance, the more clients we get,” he explained. “I’ve never had to expand my label into t-shirts and jeans.”Dreamlike design aside, Reed is not immune to the financial and creative quagmire in which the London fashion industry has found itself in recent months, fueled in part by the implosion of luxury retailer Matchesfashion. His response? “Put on a real show,” he enthused, of his decision to return to the subterranean tanks of the Tate Modern, with a theatrical caged show set, that nodded to the winged corsets and crinolines in his collection. As part of his seasonal research, Reed visited the archives of the V&A Museum, studying the architectural construction of corsets handled by white-gloved women. Like last season, the designer decided against a live catwalk performance by the likes of Florence Pugh or Sam Smith, because he knows that his clothes deliver more than enough drama. “I don’t know how not to be a showman,” he said.', 'Spirals and ouroboros are a recurring theme this spring, in set design and product. At Heliot Emil, the models walked a labyrinthine path that brought them in close proximity to the audience and the show’s centerpiece, a hanging “chandelier,” created in collaboration with the Swiss design studio Encor, and made of square sheets of electrochromic glass. Simply put, the transparency of the glass reacted to the soundtrack. From the get-go Copenhagen-based Heliot Emil has aligned itself with technology and espoused an industrial, protective, hypebeast-meets-motorsport aesthetic. There have been 3D printed accessories and a made-for-meming model walk of flame. This season the Juul brothers, Victor (business director) and Julius (creative director) dialed down the pyrotechnics in order to put more attention on the clothes. Said Julius: “I wanted to create something that was a bit more intimate this time and a bit more personal, where people could really see the work we did with the textures and the fabrics.”On the heels of a spring collection co-designed with AI and presented on virtual models, it was a wise decision to bring things back down to earth, and show how the clothes can exist in a real-life context. Ten years ago in Louisiana, the designer saw Olafur Eliasson’s Riverbed, a site-specific installation of stones and a stream in the museum. This inspired the patterned knits with meandering lines, and the somber palette of the collection. Rocks strung onto necklaces and left on guests’ seats suggested a return to nature as well, but it wasn’t as straightforward as that: the stones were sourced on the internet. “It’s kind of ironic to sell stones or to buy stones online; it seems like something so futuristic and so old at the same time,” Julius said. “It’s a really weird construct, but I thought that that was an interesting concept and obviously a reflection of what Eliasson did [in bringing] the stones from outside into the museum and giving them a different context or perspective.” Another example of reversal in the collection was bulbous sneaker shoes, made with Italy’s Staccato, inspired by the 3D printed shoes of past collections.Julis noted that as he’s able to indulge his penchant for defensive, motorsport designs through Heliot Emil’s ongoing collaborations with Alpine Stars, this collection was more about layering and texture mixes and the puffy, protective elements were toned down in favor of a more bodycon silhouette, with the notable exception of a padded jacket with a sort of anatomical vibe made, the designer said, with about 70 pattern pieces, with slits between some of them for an airier effect.', 'Fashion has taken a turn for the sexy. It tends to happen in spring seasons, but this year it’s more pronounced than ever, with cone bras from the 1950s and Victorian underpinnings like hoop skirts and pantaloons from more than half a century earlier turning up on the runways. Hermès’s Nadège Vanhée had a similar instinct: “What I want to convey as the message is the idea of an assertive sensuality,” she said. “You know, it’s about the summer, a feel-good summer, and, really, this relationship you have with your skin.” Only she isn’t interested in the styles of the past; she’s thinking about the way to put a luxury spin on the sheer trend, and how the Hermès clients would mix it with her leather pieces.Vanhée’s proposal was sheer mesh, which she cut into fluid pants with zips up the sides that can be undone, if the mood strikes, to create the suggestion of a maxiskirt shape. While intertwining lightness and sturdiness, she paired these with leather jackets cut as thin as cotton that were cropped and left open over a bra top or cut like an anorak and belted at the waist. They were shapes lifted from activewear, with the casual, relaxed attitude to match. Her message about feeling comfortable in your skin was especially resonant because she was one of the few designers to cast models of diverse sizes this season in Paris, where many others have stubbornly and frustratingly reverted to the size-0 mien.Another way Vanhée caught the lightness everyone wants in summer was to use the silk twill of Hermès’s famous scarves—in this case both block- and screen-printed—for breezy garments like a shirtdress built on leather shoulders or a short romper. A woven leather dress and another in embroidered mesh picked up the graphic pattern of the scarves, and save for a few fuchsia looks, everything came in warm neutral shades that looked baked by the sun. Providing a steady foundation for these vacation-ready pieces was Vanhée’s typically excellent footwear: streamlined and chic riding boots on the one hand, and on the other, playful but practical clog sandals.', '“Something to look forward to” was the season’s motto for Michelle Ochs at Hervé Léger. The designer is celebrating a milestone birthday this year with her first big trip in some time, she said, which put her in a wanderlust state of mind as she approached her spring lineup.The idea here was to imbue some positivity, paired with a wardrobe versatile enough to pack up and travel. But Ochs’s birthday and a well-deserved holiday are not all she has ahead of her. This lineup marks a full year of the designer at the label, which has undergone a series of tepid revamps over the past decade or so. Now with a sampling of every season and preseason under her belt, Ochs could really get to work and take Hervé Léger into unexplored territory.There was the color: vibrant pastels paired with neutrals and primary reds and blues. The shapes: minidresses, cocktail sheaths, and floor-length gowns fashioned both in the signature Hervé Léger bandage knit and softly draped jersey. And the details: Ochs explored the label’s couture archives to find techniques she could apply to her ready-to-wear, she said at a preview. Most striking was the way she had bandage strips fold and twist away from the body to build a sense of depth in the shape of peekaboo cutouts, and how she layered rounded panels under straight strips to create a playful yet flattering optical illusion. Ochs also expanded the classic bandage language by softly scalloping its edges or inserting mesh in between strips. “I always ask, ‘How do we give her something she hasn’t seen?’” said the designer. The way in which Ochs has managed to introduce a set of new yet approachable iterations of the Hervé Léger language every season since taking on the job should be commended. Not every designer is able to merge a sense of ingenuity with solid commercial appeal.“I think it’s come a long way,” said Ochs, reflecting on her year at Hervé Léger. “My goal was always for her to feel like a woman today.” That she’s done. “I want to give her legs,” the designer said when she presented an initial preview of her collection at the Vogue offices just over a year ago. She really meant pants and separates then, but transforming her statement into a metaphor seems apropos here: Ochs’s Hervé Léger certainly has the potential to go the distance.', \"Twelve days ago Ellen Hodakova Larson won the prestigious LVMH Prize, becoming the first Swede to do so. This, plus a plethora of celebrity endorsements via the red carpet (here's looking at you, Cate Blanchett), meant that there was greater interest in her show than ever before. The spring collection worked as a primer to those new to the Hodakova world, and held plenty of interest for those who were better acquainted with it.There are many points of differentiation to Larsson’s work; foremost among them is the designer herself.  She’s a feet-on-the-ground person who is happiest in the country surrounded by woods and fields and horses and dogs. Her upcycling approach to fashion is based on the make-do and mend values she grew up with. This season the designer took a walk down memory lane. “For me it’s been a dive into warmth and feeling proud about where you come from,” she said. “I find so much comfort in going back in memories… and my memories are in objects, so it’s more about smells, images, pieces—all of the physical things.” Because of the materials they are made of, deadtock, vintage, and salvage, Hodakova’s designs evoke the past. They carry tales, but neither the designer nor her garments are retro, rather Larsson’s aim is, she explained, “to be present all the time.”By this she seems to mean to be curious, to question and explore. She doesn’t want to dwell in the past, but look at what is in new ways. Can a boot be made into a dress? (Mais oui!) But also, how can one go about doing fashion in a new way? And where is value and preciousness to be found? It’s a fallacy, I think, to say that fashion is democratic, but Larsson’s materials come close to meeting that definition. In her eyes nacre buttons, plastic eyeglass lenses, and zippers are jewels and discarded status symbols; like démodé fur hats can become coquettish dresses.There was a touch of Surrealism in Larsson’s boots with two sets of uppers, and a grown-up sense of sensuality in body-hugging dresses made of many, many, many zippers, which fell loose into sonorous fringe at the hems. It’s funny that the Hodakova show was held so close to Elsa Schiaparelli’s maison, as the designer also worked with these then-new fasteners and is famous for her collaborations with artists like Salvador Dalí. Shocking pink, and generally getting a rise out of people, was Schiap’s m.o.; Larsson leads by example by following her heart. Still, this season had its dramatic moments. Materiality has been the designer’s main focus, but she said she wanted to focus more on silhouettes, and did so with some face-covering column dresses, done her way. We’ve seen similar shapes elsewhere; the starting point for these, the designer said, was mushrooms. (Mushroom gathering is quite a popular pastime in Scandinavia.)In order for Larsson to use landscape paintings as fabric for garments and an amazing tote bag, she had to take them out of their frames, hence the frame dresses. The argyles of last season were back and looking as desirable as ever; they were a good compliment to a tweed jacket with shirt and sweater sleeves built into to give the casual tied-around-the-neck-look. Adding a Swedish country touch were looks made of red and white checked and monogrammed dish clothes. There were woven belt bags made in the shape of traditional wooden berry and gathering baskets, the latter worn like backpacks.Charming as these homey, rustic  touches were, they shared space with truly sophisticated looks, and also functioned like breadcrumbs pointing to Larsson’s higher purpose. “I want to give a little bit of warmth and harmony; I want to showcase and highlight an enjoyable life,” she said. Often, “comfort means following a route or a system, but I think we can make our own routes instead of following all of the others,” she continued, [and this will allow us to] “see potential in things with which we can create our own worlds.”\", 'It’s homecoming season at Holzweiler. After putting on two shows in London, the team headed back to Norway—not to Oslo, where they are headquartered, but way, way up north to the island of Krøttøya where the lookbook was photographed. A former military base, this tiny 1.3-square-kilometer rocky area, which is accessed by boat, is now inhabited mostly by fishermen in painted wooden houses, the interiors of which were a starting point for some of the lace, hand crochet, and florals in the collection. Yet the vibe is fresh. Said Maria Skappel: “we wanted to bring the energy of two young people coming to this island, maybe visiting  their childhood home or their grandparents… [and] exploring the memories of the past from these people that live there.” The lived-in aesthetic felt just right, too.Keeping things up-to-date were delightful details such as long shorts, sun-faded khakis with curved seams, patchworked fishermen sweaters with a new cursive logo, and the perfect plaid shirt. The sporty sunglasses are an IYKYK touch; they’re very “much a Norwegian thing,” said Skappel. And while they are trending now in Oslo, “in general, people always dress very sporty.” And they usually layer, and not just for styling. The weather is variable and people spend lots of time outside. Note the thin sweaters to wear one-on-top-of-the-other and the intarsia pull-overs which are effectively postcards of Krøttøya’s naturescape.Recalibration is a concept that came up during the spring season, and you really get the sense that Holzweiler has returned to center with this collection. Though titled Memories, it can serve as a blueprint for the future. The strength of this brand is in being authentic to its Norwegian roots, building on knitwear (a national patrimony) and translating the functional and outdoorsy element of the local wardrobe into fashion that can work anywhere in the world.Globalization can make the world feel flat, but local flavor gives fashion a sense of dimensionality. Plus, Holzweiler is an upbeat, grounded brand. “At this time, it’s either you have to go full into the political side…or you have to take the other angle and try to communicate something a bit more positive… and just focus within and try to find what really matters to you,” said Skappel. “That’s the angle we took on this collection; it’s [tied] to memories and also belonging, as in, ‘This is Norway, this is our culture.’ ” Spring’s offering feels like a warm welcome.', \"Tracy Reese was “really feeling one-shoulder this season,” she said over Zoom, adding that she’s not a fan of “tricky” clothes, but does want her collection to feel interesting. To that end, for resort 2025, she used the silhouette for tops with sash details, dresses with drawstring waists, and a flouncy cropped blouse. Small details—like mini pom poms along the side seams of wide-leg pants and eyelet peeking out from the hem of slip dresses—added a touch of whimsy to a collection that allowed the wearer to “look feminine but still feel powerful,” Reese said. “I think it's great to be able to balance the two.” Oversized, pajama-inspired looks and gauzy fabrications with smocked detailing will allow them to be comfortable, too.The collection’s cohesion is not so obvious; prints run the gamut from candy-colored stripes to a trellis ironwork, and the range includes both slouchy suiting and structured, A-line mini dresses. But there’s a through-line in Reese’s use of eco-friendly fabrics like washed organic linen (for a boxy, cropped button-down), Tencel jersey (for cutout dresses), and Naia satin (for slip skirts). A leader in sustainably-made fashion, Reese is approaching two years in the Detroit design studio that also houses the Hope for Flowers showroom, apprenticeship program, and production unit. (The aforementioned one-shoulder dresses will be fully produced there.)All of Reese’s prints come to life in Detroit as well, like the oversized gingham on a pair of linen short-shorts, and an overcoat, among other separates. “I took a giant piece of watercolor paper and mixed the paint, and I drew a very light grid and mixed my tones and filled in my boxes,” Reese says of creating the gingham. “I'm always a little intimidated when I get started,” but it's worth the effort because sometimes it works out.\", 'The Row-ification of fashion has been a good thing for House of Dagmar, the Stockholm-based brand that embraces a traditional kind of minimalism and is known for oversize jackets and tailoring, as well as the use of soft tones. “I’m not super into colors but I can really nerd into the different shades of white, the different shades of natural tones,” said creative director Sofia Wallenstam on a call. Based in Stockholm, the label continues to expand its footprint stateside; it’ll be in Bergdorf Goodman starting this August.Knits, the brand’s mainstay, were present in the combined resort/spring collection, but they weren’t the main story. This outing was a bit more experimental than usual, Wallenstam said the aim was a sort of expressionist take on the minimal. The results were mixed, with some garments feeling heavy-handed. Images of garden statuary and drapery seem to have inspired such pieces as an ochre dress with a rippling sculpted bodice on an ochre dress and summery crisp cotton separates with tucking details. Contrasting with the relative stiffness of manipulated fabric were more supple designs. These include a perfect tank, a bit ’30s in style, with a subtle, sensuous drape, a bow-blouse with exaggerated streamers, and a collarless blazer with two sets of sleeves, one meant to be tied casually around the waist. A great pair of jeans made with washed Japanese denim had a softer, easier vibe that feels right for now.', 'Huishan Zhang fully immersed himself in the work of Wong Kar Wai as he designed his spring 2025 collection. Specifically The Hand—a short film from the director’s anthology, Eros—which details the relationship of a young tailor and his client.References were both direct and subtle. The most obvious was the finale look: a royal blue dress decorated with crystals, an interpretation of one in the film. Zhang broadly translated Wong’s cinematography with a new technique of threading printed plastic with organza, seen on a coat and two dresses, which made for an interesting textural departure from his signature crystal and beaded embellishments (both also featured heavily in the collection).Other material explorations included intricate sequined patterns, cast onto a long-sleeve top, a skirt, and a dress; angular salmon pink neoprene, to create a contrast for more delicate elements; and cotton-poplin adorned with crystal motifs. Tailoring has become a big part of the business, Zhang reveals—two Italian wool jackets with diamond necklines featured in the midsection—though dresses was the clear focus for spring. The cheongsam silhouette was Zhang’s “muse.” “I believe there’s an invisible cheongsam for every woman in the world; it protects them and empowers them,” he said, so details like high necklines and capped sleeves were morphed into new silhouettes.“I wanted to design a complete wardrobe for the woman, rather than focus on one area of her life,” he said before the show, held in a venue on Cavendish Square that reminded him of scenes from Wong’s work. Zhang achieved this resolve through his own lens: His version of a classic trench coat, complete with beads, would be a bold outerwear choice for daytime, and a cardigan–pencil-skirt combination (beaded too) would take wearing something beneath to become office appropriate. But that’s exactly the designer’s intention: “We want to give them day and night; day through to the evening.”', 'Whatever newness materializes on the runways of the men’s and haute couture collections over the next 10 days, no name on the calendar will come anywhere near the unbridled designs from the Bachelor of Arts graduating year students of the Institut Français de la Mode.“There is a sense of great freshness, and in this heavy world today, I think this show plays out like a kind of parenthesis of joy, of happiness,” said the school’s dean, Xavier Romatet, as guests entered the campus building’s covered terrace overlooking the Seine at the eastern edge of Paris. “It shows how fashion is here to bring pleasure to those who create it, those who watch it, and those who wear it.”The IFM Bachelor of Arts show differs from the Masters of Arts in Fashion and Knitwear catwalk that took place in March, most obviously because the students are at a point on their design journey where concept and artistic experimentation count as much, if not more, than technique.Today’s extravaganza shone a spotlight on 31 students among the 70 who are in their final year. Selected by a jury, they each presented six looks; beyond developing a theme, they had total carte blanche. And whether flying an extra-large freak flag, envisioning garments for a dystopian blockbuster, or pushing the wearable possibilities of unwearable materials, this cohort proved especially gutsy.They left it all on the runway: the kitsch (Katherine Zhi Wen Chen) and the kink (Paco Fausset Leroy-Thomas); the surrealist nods (Hyeonseo Yoo) and the special effects (Zoé Lübken). There were garments with extra body parts (Théophane Sorin, Alexander Lacqua); and garments that restricted body parts (Alessio Rubin Pedrazzo, Emanuel Simmerle). There was a twisted take on Parisian haute couture (Noah Almonte) and an Americana rodeo series on par with Pharrell’s Fall LV collection (Anthony Iacones). Two designers recontextualized the codes of their home countries–Valentin Prinz from Germany and Franck Wadji from the Ivory Coast–with impressive skill and originality. And Antonin Vogel’s workmanship with window blinds recalled how Paco Rabanne pioneered the transformation of metal scraps into high fashion. If deconstruction was the leading trend, fetish came a close second (like a rite of passage for artists at this age).“I always say, at the end, you will work in fashion; so you need to know how to make a jacket or trench coat. Then within this frame, you can do whatever you want,” said Thierry Rondenet, who oversees the program with Hervé Yvrenogeau.In these times of student unrest and pro-Palestine encampments on campuses around the world, any number of the collections could have veered overtly political and possibly contentious. Instead, as the designers emerged for the finale, each walked with one of their models while wearing a unified message: “Ceasefire Now” stamped in black on their own white shirts. The impact was emphatic without taking away from their pursuit of pure creation.', 'Why go wild in the country when you can go wild in Paris? That’s Isabel Marant’s thinking for spring. She simultaneously dipped into the early 1980s vibe of mohawked Annabella Lwin and her band, Bow Wow Wow—their big hit was “Go Wild in the Country,” of course—and the tribalist punkiness of the era in general, which was then filtered through what Marant does so well and so effortlessly: Make great clothes.As to the specifics, this was a hypnotically fantastic mélange of intricate braiding and embroideries for colorful silk chevron short dresses; weathered black-gray denim blousons; studded black leather shorts; lots of chamois-effect suede\\xa0blanket-stitched with leather, some of it swished with fringe; flat moccasin boots; suede hippie-ish satchel bags; weighty gold bangles; and, oh yes, that eternal Marant accessory—legs.(Also, I hate to interrupt your review-reading pleasure for a minute, but a quick aside on Bow Wow Wow. The band was looked after by the late pop svengali Malcolm McLaren, the onetime manager of the Sex Pistols, and he hired the teenage Lwin to front the band, figuring she’d be malleable and easily manipulated. Au contraire: Lwin turned out to know her own mind and was always ready to stand her ground. Sounds like the archetypal Marant woman, if you ask me.)At a preview for her collection, Marant and her design director, Kim Bekker, were pulling off the racks all manner of intricately worked pieces: a shrug on a jacket, which fluttered because of its silken, almost iridescent strands of fringing; a beige and abstract print top patched together, its seams accentuated by braiding that zigzagged all over it; and two long dresses, one black, the other metallic gray, constructed out of panels held together by silver pearl-like balls and flashing a touch of skin.This was an artisanally ambitious collection from Marant. “I wanted to go back to our roots, do something really craft-y,” she said. “It’s about a tribe of really strong women. And there was a bit of a vibe of the Amazon.” She showed a striking swirling needleworked dress whose pattern, formed from the weaving of its silk yarn, had been inspired by South American butterflies. “It was really these soft and warm colors we wanted, almost like the colors of a sunset,” Bekker said of the collection’s palette of rust, mauve, pink, and purple. “And the wings have this almost velvety texture that we wanted too.”One of the things that has been bubbling up over the last few days when talking about spring’s collections is considering the difference between the male gaze and the female gaze. It’s always been a conversation, but somehow it’s gotten more frequent, more persistent than ever before. When it comes to Marant, there definitely is a difference: Every collection is a study in fashion as a conspiratorial gesture of solidarity to women. In other words, it’s like she and Bekker are saying: We understand you, and we will make clothes you can understand—and wear.For instance, it may be that some of her women want the lankier leggy look that Marant does so well, but don’t necessarily want to show their legs: The label’s newer trousers, with their lean, cropped, kick-flared look to the rescue. Also, as Marant indicated with the show’s shoes lining the studio floor, nothing gets higher than a tiny kitten heel, but most everything else is super-flat. “We wanted the girls to be in flats,” Marant said, “to make them feel liberated. No one really wears heels anymore.”', 'Consideration abounded at Issey Miyake this morning. The park-set pavilion location was both a short walk from the immediately-before, way-out-of-town Loewe show, and also finely appropriate for the collection. The round stools used for seating were cut from compressed cylinders of paper, ready for recycling, that are a byproduct of the core Miyake pleating process whose commercial appeal is so powerfully enduring.These seats were a gesture to preface a collection that leafed through several series of looks conceived around paper. The opening shrouded outfits emerged to the sound of dripping water: the oozing curves of the internally-fastened draping and wet-look gleam on the semi-transparent fabric was meant, you guessed, to reflect the look of damp paper. Next was a sextet of looks in taupe, white or black in a material whose mix of washi (hemp paper) and silk-rayon were shot with stretch yarn: this allowed Satoshi Kondo to craft fold-detailed silhouettes that were both angular and flexible, and whose surface retained the dimpled texture of traditional Japanese hemp paper.Hemp-mix knits were used to build looks in irregularly segmented sections of jumbled tone and texture. Stiffish woven hemp fabric was built into tailoring with silhouettes much more defined. Single piece pleated looks were twisted around the models into body-wrappings: some twirled or stretched against the garments as they walked to demonstrate their springy, elastic cling.There were a few gentle paper-related gags written in. One look was decorated with crocodile clips, and there was a paper bag handbag whose yarn integrated washi. Pressed leaf and flower eyewear and hat brims or masks preceded a beautiful series of wrinkled silk looks decorated with pressed floral prints. Delicacy and impact combined in a collection that left a beguiling imprint.', 'Earlier this year, a trend dubbed the “office siren” or “corpcore” reached vitality on TikTok, with young people cosplaying as sexed-up office workers (many of them Gen Z-ers who had never set foot in an office) in a fetishization of pre-pandemic corporate America. So when Jane Wade set out to skewer corporate culture in her spring 2025 collection, she faced the challenge of avoiding the microtrend sand trap. Luckily, she passed with flying colors.With “The Audit,” Wade—one of this year’s CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists—delivered an offering with a strong point of view and a healthy dose of humor. “We’re studying corporate greed, the cornerstone of morality within corporate culture, and what it means to be a little bit sneaky to elevate yourself,” she said. While she poked fun at this with her subverted workwear and styling (the briefcase overflowing with money was an inspired touch), Wade sought to touch on a more serious issue: “In corporate America with profit shifting and tax evasions, legal ways and illegal ways to kind of conceal our money, the rich get richer and the poor stay poor.”An expert world-builder, Wade created an airtight narrative for the collection, giving each look a persona to fulfill. She costumed the low-level whistleblower in a sporty hoodie and white boxer shots, the auditor in a dip-dyed silk dress with exposed raw-edged seams and a sheer crocheted chainmail top, and the CEO who closed the show in gray shorts with white piping and a matching blazer with comically oversized shoulder pads.The Oregon-born designer struck the balance between showcasing wearable clothing—like the swishy asymmetrical jersey dresses and the cotton poplin skirt sets that subverted the staple button-down—with the avant garde, like the high-low dress made of shreds of paper. (“These are my shredded tax returns and my actual contracts from this season,” Wade said.) She also prides herself on using natural fabrics, be it silk charmeuse or cotton.Although Jane Wade is a young brand, house codes were present throughout spring 2025: chevron stitching, chainmail bound with crochet and weaving, and dip-dyeing. Wade, the daughter of a contractor and a hairdresser, also values utilitarian touches. “[We are] showcasing the American culture through canvas and denim and hardware textures,” she said. “So we have that dichotomy of corporate, disheveled office wear, mixed with functional performance garments.”Wade said of her customer: “She’s on the go. She’s powerful. She’s sexy. She probably has a corporate job. She wants to still express herself within the confines of office wear.” Or, more likely, she’s a cool girl with a soul-crushing job and a talent for compartmentalization. But she’s always the best dressed in the office by a mile!', 'Remember COVID and the endless talk about change; change that, for the most part, never materialized. If the industry isn’t self-adjusting, that leaves it up to designers to write the script going forward. Jason Wu has accepted the challenge. “I just think the pendulum has to shift, and I can only start with myself,” he said on a preshow call. This season, Wu, like Alejandro Gómez Palomo, announced he is trying out a one-show-a-year model. Having made that decision, he wanted to do something especially memorable. So he secured the public square and gardens at Hudson Yards and worked with his friends Mary and David Martin and their nonprofit, MADWORKSHOP, to commission a sculpture, INK 01 / 6A 6B 6C, by Elise Co, a designer and technologist, in collaboration with artist Ben Borden, through which the models walked. Made of sheet steel, the hard, solid geometry of its structure contrasted with the fluid elements of the clothes.The idea for the sculpture grew out of Wu’s primary inspiration, the work of Chinese artist Tong Yang-Tze, who, at age 82, the show notes reported, “will be the first Asian artist to create works for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Great Hall commission this November.” Expect to hear much more from Tong. Based in Taipei, she creates large-size pieces using Chinese calligraphy. It’s not necessary to be able to read the characters to appreciate the airy, graphic, and gestural aspects of her work.When you put something down on paper, it has the potential to live forever. (We are still reading Shakespeare, for example.) Wu was taught calligraphy as a child, but his chosen medium is fabric. He did adapt some of Tong’s work as prints, but more important was the way the work inspired his own. The opening look was a coat that was screen-printed after it had been produced, which left some of the underfabric exposed. Nodding to painters’ canvas, the designer incorporated this material into his collection this season, where it shared space with silk, chiffon, and muslin. But it was ink, murky yet fluid, that really captured his imagination; he worked a lot with flou for spring, and lightness. This was reflected in his palette, a mix of pastels and black and white.', 'Jawara Alleyne is on a roll. This summer alone, the designer has—deep breath—been nominated for an emerging designer prize at this year’s Fashion Awards, collaborated with the artist Alvaro Barrington on a major commission at the Tate Britain, and delivered a string of custom looks for his growing celebrity fan base that culminated in the latest bespoke piece for Rihanna: a draped chocolate brown silk dress that the singer stepped out in during NYFW. (Back in April, Rihanna declared Alleyne her “new favorite designer” in Interview magazine.) Yet Alleyne is taking it all in his stride. “It’s exciting, but my focus is always on my practice,” he said at a preview. “I just try to keep things on a level, stay grounded, and then it’s not really so daunting.”Alleyne’s levelheadedness can be, at least in part, chalked up to the fact he’s been in the game for a while now, having spent the best part of a decade as one of London fashion’s greatest secrets. (He first emerged as part of the wave of talent that produced Ib Kamara and Campbell Addy, and kept things ticking over through drops via Nasir Mazhar’s Fantastic Toiles and then an impressive string of collections with Lulu Kennedy’s Fashion East.) What a pleasure it was, then, to see him decide to go out on his own: From his first show two years ago, held in a Whitechapel church, it’s been clear that Alleyne has that special something.An enthusiastic crowd of Alleyne’s friends and fans—Normani included—filtered into a compact space off the Strand and sat on a mishmash of chairs and sofas scattered around the room, before the lights went up and a foot-tapping soundtrack crafted by music collective Vivendii with a little help from Kamara and Alleyne’s musician brother Tafari came on. The title of the collection, Island Underground, nodded to Alleyne’s upbringing on the Cayman Islands, and the mystical air that hung over the ensuing show—models walked slowly and deliberately, weaving around the pockets of seating, with fabric dragging behind them as if they’d just been rescued from a shipwreck—had an electric energy.For Alleyne, embarking on his journey as a designer and delving deeper into his Caribbean identity has been therapeutic. While growing up, he resented the limitations of being so far away from the world’s fashion capitals, and he looked to heroes in Paris like Alber Elbaz, Alexander McQueen, and Karl Lagerfeld: “To me, being inspired by the islands felt a little bit restricting,” he said. But his interest in reconciling these two sides of himself has now ended up producing some of his most striking work. “I think there are a lot of brands that are just pulling from culture, and so I think it’s really important for me as a designer to make sure my collections aren’t just inspired by that culture but give back,” he added. (To wit, tonight’s show was presented in partnership with the Cayman Islands ministries of culture and tourism, and Alleyne will be taking the collection to show at their National Gallery in November.)', 'Jenny Packham often draws on the glamour of the past to dress her glamorous woman in the present day. Yet her journeys across cultural and cinematic history typically locate themselves somewhere in the 20th century—and not in the annals of ancient Egypt. “I’ve been waiting for ages for the Grand Egyptian Museum to open in Cairo, and it’s now in the soft-opening stage,” said Packham, who, despite her brand’s association with upper-crust Englishness, is also something of an adventurer. “I went there years ago and got very inspired, so it felt like the right time to return to that inspiration.”Unsurprisingly, perhaps, one of Packham’s starting points was Cleopatra—whether representations of the great Egyptian queen from her own time, or her famous interpretation by Elizabeth Taylor in the 1963 blockbuster opposite Richard Burton. But given Packham’s magpie’s eye for glitz, she was also drawn to the ancient Egyptians’ dazzling use of color and metallics. “They were the first to create a blue pigment from lapis lazuli, so we incorporated that into the collection,” she said, smiling. “And plenty of gold and silver of course.” (As Packham also noted, some historians say ancient Egypt was the first civilization to introduce the concept of luxury goods.)Packham’s party season dresses were all present and ready for their big nights out come summer 2025, whether a dress dripping in royal blue sequins and beading with fierce power shoulders, or a more playful gold and silver sequin and crystal tunic dress that seemed to shimmy off the hanger and straight onto the dance floor. But Packham also noted that her styles with capes and those made from crepe fabrics have been flying off the shelves, in particular designs that offer a more restrained opulence.For while Packham’s designs are certainly opulent, they’re also—for the woman with the occasion to wear them—strangely practical. There’s a reason why it’s a certain kind of no-nonsense creative woman that is drawn to them, notably Kate Winslet, who has worn Packham on the red carpet for a handful of premieres for her new Lee Miller biopic, and Adele, who wore several styles during her sold-out concerts in Munich and Las Vegas this summer. The timelessness of Packham’s gowns seems to hold a particular appeal for the kind of totemic cultural figure whose legacies will likely remain for centuries to come—the Cleopatras of today, you could even argue.', 'Lucie and Luke Meier pursued a darker, more powerful vision at Jil Sander today. Backstage they called it a reaction to the world environment. There’s an almost inescapable only-the-strong-survive quality to our current moment, so it’s somewhat surprising to see fashion leaning into prettiness. That was more or less the Meiers’ position last season, when they focused on swaddled shapes and feminine gestures. Their response this season seemed to have been tweaked for the harsh realities of our time.They took their cues from the work of the Canadian photographer Greg Girard, who was in the audience. His images of 20th-century cars and motel rooms appeared as prints, the former on a boxy shirt and pencil skirt and the latter on a caban and matching shift that complemented the show’s carpeted runway. Girard’s neon-lit nighttime photos also informed the collection’s palette, from the iridescent suiting for men and women that opened the show—jackets and pants (or shorts) matching shirt and tie—to the glossy brake-light red of a trench that came near the end. The tailored silhouettes had echoes of the 1940s and ’80s, fashion eras of outsized proportions; this was especially true of the double pleats and loose shape of the pants, but they managed to create a vibe without looking too retro.Talk of dark forces aside, the Meiers made room for light, softer elements. These took the form of a couple of dip-dyed shirt-and-skirt sets, a pastel midi-dress featuring scrolling decoration, and rib-knit separates with curving hems trimmed in little beads. They still have an eye for the handcrafted touches they were more intent on pre-pandemic, too, as seen in tops for both genders with inset crochet panels and three-dimensional floral embroidery.As for the Lonely Hearts pendant necklaces and a man’s sweater stitched with those same words? Maybe they spoke of an inner tenderness; under our hard shells there are sensitivities of all kinds. That’s what the final look, a bouquet-printed glossy black raincoat, appeared to be saying: I’m strong but also soulful.', 'The soulful notes of a live flamenco performance filled the air at Johanna Ortiz’s presentation, setting the tone for an emotional show. “I wanted to reconnect with my roots and fully embrace my Hispanic heritage,” she said backstage. “This collection truly comes from my heart.” Ortiz infused her designs with energy and authenticity. The vibrancy of colors and prints; the sensual flow of ruffles; the curving, fluid silhouettes; the bohemian spirit—it all came together in an expressive collection where each piece seemed to reflect her feisty, warm, and engaging personality.“Colors came to me with an urgency this season,” she said. “I didn’t want to hold back.” Bookended by white and black looks, the lineup radiated a rich spectrum of sunset hues, earthy terra-cottas, lush emerald greens, deep reds, and ocean blues. The prints were equally vivid, drawing loose inspiration from the geometry of Moorish architecture. “It’s time to embrace color, to embrace joy. We’re fortunate to work in fashion while the world feels so messy, and in times like these, we need to listen to what our hearts and souls are telling us,” she said. Beyond her distinct vision as a designer, Ortiz is an entrepreneur who has grown a sustainable business dedicated to empowering artisan women’s communities in her native Colombia. Kudos to the consistency of her purpose, steadfast commitment, and humanity—utterly relevant today more than ever.', 'Three seasons at London incubator Fashion East put Johanna Parv on the map, and spring marked her first solo turn, supported by NewGen. The Estonia-born designer makes clothes with a defined purpose—her customer wears them for work, play, and commutes in between—which models demonstrated as they unfurled jackets and stashed them into clever pockets on the runway. Bags were moved from shoulders to around their necks: ready to ride.Mere hours after this smooth catwalk choreography, Parv did the same movements in her studio. A zip revealed more leg or “let some air in”; a bag was worn around the waist, then across the body, or worn as a sleeve. Parv explained the pep talk she gave her models before they were tasked with walking and simultaneous tucking: “Whatever you do, whatever happens, own it. It’s not a mistake; it’s normal for this to happen on the street.”Parv is so at one with her clothes that it’s impossible to forget these multiway solutions were made with her own practicalities in mind: “It’s a personal need of what I like,” she said. For instance, she gladly runs in her cropped tanks, complete with grippy silicone dots on the interior—the same seen across socks, headbands, and darted tops this season—which she’s innovating to be supportive so you can wear them sans bra.One particular dress, developed in an aluminum gray water-resistant stretch and a black waterproof-cotton ripstop, has been in her head for eight years. True to her captivating presence that comes to life when she talks about her designs, Parv offered an anecdote about balancing the beauty and functionality of this dress to some fragile heart-shaped glasses given to her by her grandmother: “When I move, I’m so stressed they’re going to break, but why can’t I just have a really beautiful glass that’s strong and durable?”Best believe all of Parv’s creations are meticulously tried and tested, no breakage here—she’s already talking about improvements she will make next season: “I have another collection to design!” And with a burgeoning business, she’s seriously attentive to the needs of her customers. A capri version of trousers from seasons past was an immediate hit, so she reintroduced them for spring and has developed her take on tailoring in wool nylon and waterproof linen. So special was the latter material development that she couldn’t source it in white in time for the runway (it was uncoated in the show), but the final sample in her studio looked and felt impressive. Expect to see more where that came from. “We want to do more with natural fibers; make them perform in certain ways,” she said.Fashion meeting function has become a “thing,” but for Parv and her crowd, it’s not transitory, it’s a way of life, a necessity. In a world of fashion problems, this designer’s solutions are refreshing. Those inspired are keen to road test.', 'Not so long ago, the NYC LGBT Center on West 13th Street held one of its annual fashion industry focused fundraising dinners. Movie producer and Center stalwart Dorothy Berwin gave a rousing call to action to get behind the space and the organization like never before, because—as if this needs saying, all too sadly—homophobia and transphobia are on the rise. Designer Jonathan Cohen, who first visited the Center in 2021, was at that dinner and took note. He visited the building some time later for a walkthrough, then committed himself to doing something. “I think of the Center as being a bit like Planned Parenthood,” he said. “It can be a refuge; knowing that it exists… it brings such a sense of comfort.”Which is why bright-ish and early-ish on a Saturday morning, we were back at the Center to see Cohen’s Spring 2025 collection. It was a symphony of: color (from bright scarlet to a shimmering midnight blue); pattern (anemone flowers rendered with a delightfully faux naif vibe, luxe-y luxe tie-dyes for cashmere sweaters and cardigans); beading and embroideries exploding like supernovas over shirting and lanky jeans; and gentle layering like a dress over a skirt over big pants, which, seen here and elsewhere, is beginning to coalesce into one idea of how you might want to dress come next spring. (Or sooner! What’s stopping you now, after all?) One other styling tip worth sharing: The spangly Swarovski colored crystal belts worn over the tie-dye cardies and lean jackets, and modeled on the necklaces of a certain editor-in-chief you may have heard of. I’ll give you a clue in case you’re scratching your head: I am currently writing this about ten feet from her office.One of Cohen’s best qualities as a designer is his intentionality. His choice of venue was one of them: The desire to do his part, make a difference, be sensitive to the world, is very Cohen. (He’s planning to get involved in workshops and open days to help young people, to demystify the industry, and to more broadly empower them as they move into adult life.) The other way it shows up is in how he meticulously researches and thinks through the starting point of any collection. One thing was uppermost as he started Spring 2025. “How can you push things forward, make the future better?” he said. “Clothing has the power to do that. I’ve always felt that—and it’s my job not to ignore it.”He alighted on music, an abiding love of his, which led him to reading about people who see colors when they listen to it—synesthesia, the condition is called. (Cohen said, laughing, that he doesn’t have it.) That in turn set him off on his foray into those aforementioned bold hues, or a rather psychedelic striped textile which is a Japanese fabric that takes some three months to make just fifteen meters of; Cohen used it for a short wrap skirt and a shoulder hugging jacket. For evening, he repurposed what was meant to be a capelet into a one-shouldered top, serendipitously discovered while styling the presentation. His way with handwork was evident in a nip waist jacket and long dress combo whose seams were lined with tiny knots. Much of this was worn with flat docker shoes—“Bringing it back to California!” said west coaster Cohen—which were trimmed with fabric orchids. And by the time all of this arrives in stores, he will already be doing all that he can for the Center. Quite a bit to admire here then, whether Cohen’s clothes—or his sense of commitment.', 'Donna Summer’s 1977 song “I Feel Love” served as the unexpected soundtrack at Junya Watanabe’s show—the alluring disco message was surprising, coming from such an elusive, mysterious designer. Yet it was the first song produced with a modular Moog synthesizer, hinting at a futuristic mood. It strangely synced with the edgy metallic glamour of the show.Watanabe is a master of creating exceptional shapes by assembling just a few elements, repeating them obsessively to craft virtuosic, single-minded designs—wondrous mash-ups where forms seem to reinvent themselves throughout, transmuting into a continuous flow of shape-shifting combinations. This season, he worked exclusively with “modern recycled materials,” as per his press notes, incorporating reflector patches, backpacks (a collaboration with Innerraum bags), soundproofing foam, and what appeared to be rubber-carpeted car interiors.The emphasis was on strong silhouettes, unusually feminine considering Watanabe’s typically abstract repertoire. The opening looks were striking, sculptural, and shiny creations made from reflective silver foil. They evoked luminous creatures in armor and featured broad shoulders with cinched waists jutting out into voluminous, bouncy round or angular pointy crinolines crafted from poufed clusters of rucksacks secured with buckled safety straps, or from what seemed like flattened rubber motorcycle tires. Balloon sleeves and square-cut collars were mounted on hourglass numbers concocted from elliptical assemblages of technical ribbons; cocoonish capelets poufed out from stark geometric-shaped opera coats, where patchworks of reflectors and soundproofing foam agglutinated into beauteous, surreal specimens—evening frocks for a galactic sci-fi party. The shine—from sequins, translucent fabrics, and reflective surfaces—radiated an outward energy, exuding an absurd, incongruous yet festive sense of joy. In his typical iconoclastic, cerebral way, Watanabe sent out a laconic note that said: “I feel that abnormal clothing is necessary in our everyday life.” Indeed.', \"Ostensibly, there was not lot to see at JW Anderson’s show. A forward march of minimal mini-silhouettes. Shapes that ran from tiny, apparently recognizable generic sweaters, sweatshirts and bombers to conceptual leather tutu-dresses. A single snub-toed leather welly-biker shoe-boot on everyone. Materials reduced to four fabrications: cashmere knit, leather, silk and sequins.But then again: Anderson was saying so much to unpack within all of this. Number one: his big-picture thinking about the parlous state of fashion after years of runaway excess: “I think where we are today is that there needs to be a kind of narrowing of things while the world is transitioning. I think fashion needs to kind of refocus somehow, because we're in a moment where we, the industry, have to look at ourselves.”Number two: how it’s entirely possible to be playfully creative with the toolbox of techniques—knitting, trompe l’oeil tricks and brand signifiers—he’s built up since he first started JW Anderson, on virtually nothing.Number three: keeping eyes open to young people’s attitudes and how they dress. Anderson talked about “a girly independence” in his post-show debrief. “A lot of what I do in the brand is reflected on my sister or people around me in the studio,” he said. When someone asked him what he meant by that, he talked about going out with his younger sister and her friends. “Maybe it’s a Northern Irish thing. They sort of pack together on a night out. They call each other ‘the girlies.’ There’s a toughness there that I like.”Avid Anderson-ologists will spot the fact that this collection was sprinkled with variations on his signatures over time: a paisley print dress, sweater dresses made of vertical strips mimicking high-rise buildings—these last a follow-on from the “house” hand-knits in his last men’s show.A printed text which recurred in this collection was the introduction to an essay on art and design by Clive Bell, the British art critic who was a member of the early 20th century Bloomsbury Group. Anderson didn’t go into detail about the thrust of this treatise. What he did say circled back to his remarks about the issues fashion is facing. “It’s more like this idea of starting from a blank page,” he said. “Where is the next decade going, and how do we work with it?”\", 'The invitation said Café Kallmeyer, but the mood inside the dimly lit, almost entirely red room was much more of a Club Kallmeyer vibe, although it was barely past 9AM. The show began and the voice of a woman saying a short speech blared over the speakers, ending in “We are talking about humanism.” Then a song began, with the lyrics “I want something more,” repeating over and over again. The lights went up and the first model walked out, in a tailored blazer worn over a semi-sheer polo and a breezy chiffon skirt; then came another in a swingy jersey dress with a draped bodice and a fitted waistband; followed by a semi-sheer plaid draped top, and a loose-fitting cream sweater layered over a satin skirt. By the time the tenth look came out, a sheer baby blue button down worn over light wash jeans—worn low to expose the Kallmeyer boxers underneath—it was clear Daniella Kallmeyer was in a lighter state of mind.“This season is very much inspired by the resort collection, which was a cheeky nod to the girl I had a crush on in high school,” she said after the show. “This collection is imagining who she grows up to be; this is how she lives her life while asserting her power with kindness.” It’s funny how notions of soft power can seem so alien to what we’re used to. At least when it comes to fashion, power is usually interpreted through strong shoulders, strict lines, something that is inherently masculine. The clothes in this collection had the opposite effect. The wide waistband on the dresses, a way to be held tight; the cape-like volume on trench coats and jackets, a way to feel enveloped. “Power can be kind,” Kallmeyer said. “Power doesn’t have to be strong in a way that is aggressive or abrasive. Female power is nurturing. We raise people. We raise women.”Her color palette was exquisite—in the past she’d been working in a sober black and white and beige and maybe a little bit of red; but this season she embraced a bold turquoise that seemed to glow against the bright red walls and floor of the show space. See also silver lavender, oxidized khaki, burgundy paired with orchid purple, her classic shirt-and-tie combo in a strangely alluring shade of mustard-goldenrod. The textures too, were sumptuous, especially a shiny satin skirt suit with a high collar, and a knitted sleeveless dress that had been woven through with leather, left in long fringes at the bottom and worn with a pair of trousers. “We’re really not trying to be stuck in this quiet luxury thing,” Kallmeyer added. “I think that’s where we were when we first started and then the trends sort of caught up with what we were doing, and now we continue to move forward.”', \"For Caçador-born Brazilian designer Karoline Vitto, there are three times of the year you should visit Rio de Janeiro: Carnival, New Year's Eve and the second of February. The latter marks the festa de Iemanjá,\\xa0the day that worshippers dedicate floral offerings to the sea, in honor of the Afro-Brazilian goddess of the ocean. Earlier this year, Vitto found herself caught up in the celebrations on a stormy day, while shooting a video on a rocky coastal outcrop for her 2024 LVMH prize nomination. “It’s beautiful because the next day the sea washes all the flowers back,” Vitto explained. “For this collection I was thinking about that tempestuous energy,” she added. For of her concept, she imagined women as goddesses emerging from the swirl of the ocean.For Vitto’s debut standalone show on the London Fashion Week schedule—after two seasons showing under talent incubator Fashion East and a Dolce & Gabbana-sponsored SS24 turn in Milan—the designer continued to refine her body-baring and size-diverse mini-dresses, body suits and tops with “subtraction cutting.” Twisted folds and plunging drapes revealed splices of bare hip, navel and shoulder, and a blown-up photographic screen print on a long décolleté-revealing dress were used not for decorative effect but to “enhance silhouette and play a game of light and dark on the body.” The collection also saw a renewed focus on denim and tailoring.Vitto’s sculptural hardware details—used to emphasize, not hide the bulges and bumps of the body—were revamped as moldable two-point brooches in collaboration with São Paulo jeweler Carlos Penna. “You can bend the metal and choose how much of the body you reveal or cover,” Vitto explained.Vitto is one of a group of burgeoning talents, including Jawara Alleyne and Standing Ground’s Michael Stewart, who use humble fabrics, like jersey and viscose, to transformative effect. “I wanted to elevate the basic rib,” she said of a paneled black dress that clung to the body with sensuous hardware inserts. For SS25, Vitto, who works primarily with stretch deadstock, also used breathable bio-based fabric innovations, manufactured by Pyratex. Blush and candyfloss pink mini-skirts and dresses inspired by the Rio sky at dawn were crafted from SeaCell, a jersey-like fabric derived from seaweed.As body inclusivity has taken a backward turn on the runway, Vitto’s smile-inducing celebration of the breadth of the female form felt more urgent than ever. In her Smithfield studio (a space sponsored by the Paul Smith Foundation, which Vitto currently shares with Paolo Carzana and Paolina Russo), the designer largely samples her pieces on a mannequin in a size UK16, and creates trousers which an adjustable fit from a size UK14 to UK20. She also incorporates days of model street casing into her show preparation.\\xa0Included in her line-up for SS25 were make-up artist Raisa Flowers, ’90s plus size model Angellika Morton, who responded to Vitto's casting call on Instagram from America, and the artist and photographer Fernanda Liberti, a friend of the designer’s from Brazil, who has walked in all of her shows. Vitto has been inspired by the path of fellow Royal College of Art graduate Sinead O’Dwyer, who used August’s Copenhagen catwalk to champion disabled bodies in fashion. “For me, construction is about drawing attention to the body that is underneath,” Vitto said. “The woman always becomes the highlight.”\", 'You can say that Kate Barton is a bit of an unconventional designer. Barton might not have the same household recognition as brands like Collina Strada, Eckhaus Latta, or Khaite, but her online virality is helping this young designer make her mark.Barton is best known for her sculptural pieces, such as her Goldfish purse or her chrome embellished accessories. However, she understands that to grow a business, you need to have not only experimental clothing but also wearable pieces. “This season, I wanted to showcase a broader yet equally innovative range while staying true to the brand’s core DNA,” said Barton. Her sculptural pieces have been immortalized on television shows like Emily in Paris. But Barton, whose team consists of women in their 20s, also honed in on what the average New Yorker would need, like a pair of trousers or an essential tank. But to give it the Barton touch, she used her technical skills to create a draped detailing above the knees to add dimension and depth. It also helps that when you sit, your knee creases will be covered by the X detailing of the pants. To mirror her famous mirrored belts, the waistband of her trousers extended out beyond the button like the end of a belt.The designer also merged her popular corset and bubble skirt this season, offering various lengths from mini to maxi. These voluminous skirts not only accentuated the female form but also served a functional purpose, doubling as convenient pockets for fidgeters or storing essentials like lip gloss and a wallet. While Barton may still be on the rise, she’s proving to be a designer who understands the importance of dressing for the female gaze.', 'Until just over a week ago, Kent & Curwen was best known as a sincere, though slightly fuddy-duddy, purveyor of gentlemanly English prep. Those connotations were dispelled, however, with its relaunch under the creative purview of Daniel Kearns, led by a poppy—but still preppy!—campaign shot by British photographer Glen Luchford.Today, Kearns continued the rollout of his youth-driven vision for the heritage brand: a 200-seat show in the sculpture-lined corridors of the Royal Academy, one of Britain’s most prestigious learning institutions. It was a canny choice of location, not just for the back-to-school vibes that September inevitably brings, but also because the setting subtly acknowledged Kent & Curwen’s foundations. Started in 1926 as a purveyor of ties to the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge universities, it quickly became a significant player in the British school uniform market.It made sense, then, that the opening looks of Kearns’s new era for the label should directly invoke that history. Amply cut blazers with 3D rosette appliqués, knife-pleated skirts slashed at the side seams or hoiked up so the hem was about halfway up the thigh, and slim shorts came in navy and charcoal wool. Blue poplin shirts, some featuring look-alike Sharpie scrawls, will trigger nostalgia in anyone who has attended a British secondary school. School team rugby shirts and cricket sweaters—both long-standing brand staples—figured prominently, the latter reimagined as a jaunty minidress as part of the label’s first womenswear offering.Granted, rethinking the oh-so-English school uniform isn’t exactly a novel premise—it’s familiar territory for the interrogation and subversion of the stuffy social conventions and mores it represents. What made Kearns’s proposal compelling was a degree of earnest homage, with the designer keenly observing how uniforms routinely present themselves on London’s streets today. “Just walking here this morning, passing all the kids heading to school at different ages, it’s such an inspiration,” Kearns said during a preview at the brand’s airy North London studio, a stone’s throw from a number of sizable secondary schools. “That was the starting point: this idea of the conformity that is set by uniforms. How they instill a sense of belonging, but then they’re almost like a starting point to create your own identity.”Later looks explored the experimentation phases that come upon leaving the framework of a uniform behind—a sentiment no doubt informed by the fact that Kearns’s son has just left school for a place at Bristol University. “There’s the idea of a transition between school and university or work—a time when there’s a huge expectation and sense of excitement as you step into adulthood, but also a nostalgia for this childhood you’re leaving behind,” he said. A burgundy bouclé jumpsuit and a double-breasted chocolate wool equestrian jacket—both sported with oversized aviator shades—channeled a sense of a girl on the cusp of womanhood toying with a vision of ladylike dressing passed down from her mother. A trench coat in crisp black gabardine came with an exaggerated storm shield, echoing the pomp of an Oxford scholar’s gown.', 'Glancing around at the Khaite crowd, guys were few and far between. Sure, there were men in attendance, but more than other shows at New York Fashion Week, this one from Catherine Holstein attracted mostly women. I think that’s because as a designer Holstein is defining how affluent style-conscious types want to look now: polished, yes, but edgy rather than pretty.Her loyalists had a surprise in store tonight, however. Holstein has connected with her softer side. “I think I’m just feeling a little warmer these days, a little earthier,” she said backstage. “Maybe it’s my son, all the warmth I get from him, but that’s the mood coming into this.”It wasn’t apparent from the beginning—the show started with a cropped tailored black jacket with the oversize proportions she tends to favor in her outerwear, worn over sheer organza trousers. But it soon became obvious that Holstein was eager to try new things, be that hand-knit ribbon peplum tops and midi skirts, crocheted separates like an apron shirt and a narrow skirt worn over pants, or airy organza tubes braided into everything from little tops to occasion dresses. “I think we got very far into the darkness, into the slickness—obviously that’s my comfort zone,” she laughed. “This is not my comfort zone, but I wanted to venture out into making myself more uncomfortable.”Not all of Holstein’s experiments connected. It may have been nearly weightless, but the volume of the unfurling organza poncho dress tended to overwhelm its model, as did other dresses that ballooned above drop waists and descended into full but tapering skirts. But that’s alright, because elsewhere there were relevant and timely takeaways for her style-conscious loyalists: as in, how right a white sleeveless shift can look over a pair of champagne hammered silk trousers and the surprise of glossy red shoes, and how necessary a leather blouson jacket looks at the moment.Holstein also pointed out a black leather dress with a built-in white strapless sweetheart neckline corset. “It’s all stretch, no boning,” she said. “Everything is about comfort and function for us.” That may not be the sexy part of the business, but designers ignore it at their peril. Holstein is determined not to make that mistake.', 'Just before this show took off, an Australian-accented announcement over the PA urged us to ensure that our essential items were in hand, plus to place any bulky items in the overhead lockers. The opening looks were made up of a series of sportily piped viscose suiting with utility details that were accessorized with rakishly eye-obscuring pillbox hats in Pan Am blue, beehive wigs, and silky scarfs shot with metal that had been twisted to have the flyaway élan of the Petit Prince. Combined with the double-face and bicolored coats that cocooned the wearer in drape and featured an inbuilt head covering that we saw later, we started to suspect we were flying somewhere over deeply filtered Pierre Cardin territory: nostalgic futurism.Backstage, Deanna Fanning said, “We were thinking about identity in moments of transit and transience.” The aviation details, she added, were significant to one of the characters she and her sister, Laura, had created as imagined ciphers upon which to hang this collection. Another character, they added, was a collector of memories: This explained the house-developed postage-stamp prints on double-front Belstaff-ish moto jackets and zippered jeans developed in collaboration with Levi’s. Apparently, the designers had to explain the archaic concept of stamps to some of their interns.A third character was dubbed “the warrior.” As well as wearing the vaguely armor-ish metal mesh pieces that also sometimes seemed deconstructed from a moto starting point, she battled through in flowingly flou bias-cut dresses in jewel-toned satins. “We’re thinking about movement and how sometimes it can be really tough to occupy space, or feel like you shouldn’t occupy it,” said Deanna. This was a precisely piloted exploration of nostalgia-shot maximalist liminal-ism that you could see the brand’s many fans being enthusiastically on board for.', 'They say a trip to Paris is life-changing, and Kim Shui’s most recent stint there this summer at the height of men’s Fashion Week may have been the lucky one that inspired her spring 2025 collection. It was perhaps there where the designer became more immersed in menswear, because at tonight’s show, she subtly debuted the brand’s first-ever menswear pieces, worn by, among others, Jake Fleming.It wasn’t just the men Shui was inspired by in Paris, but also Matthew Barney’s “Secondary” exhibition at the Fondation Cartier. There, she saw his terra-cotta sculptures and recalled the ancient Japanese art practice of kintsugi. “The collection started with the idea of kintsugi, the philosophy of broken pottery that is repaired with gold resin coming back stronger,” the designer explained. “It’s more resilient, and I like the idea of it being this unity, that something comes out more beautiful than before.” This evening, Shui did a little bit of kintsugi of her own, taking bits and pieces from her past collections. The Ming-era florals that first got her brand on the map, the fierce Y2K touch from her fall 2023 show, and the whimsical dreaminess of spring 2024 all came together. Corsets were made with patent leather at the waist for that extra-cinched look, while romantic straps grazed the shoulders. Shui’s signature short shorts stayed micro in the back but were given a modest ’60s touch in the front with higher waists and romantic ruffle detailing.But back to the menswear. There was no announcement of its debut in the show notes or in the preview, but judging by the slew of men’s magazine editors invited tonight, one should have had an inkling of what will come later. Shui herself is a beloved icon (check out her Instagram; most of downtown’s cool kids were in attendance on her birthday), always wearing her pieces no matter the occasion, and you’ll find her circle repping the brand as well. Now, as part of this savvy business move, she is opening up her world even more so that everyone can join the party.', \"If there was an award for the most atmospheric and thematically apt venue at London Fashion Week this season, the Knwls space would certainly be up there. At their show tonight, designers Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault were given the run of the old Central Saint Martins building in Holborn, which has laid dormant since 2011, the former classrooms\\xa0collecting dust. As a soundtrack of krautrock and Swedish grunge began blasting from the speakers, flakes of crumbling plaster were shaken from the ceiling as if a sleeping giant was reawakening. And while it was the Charing Cross campus down the road that technically played host to the school’s legendary fashion program (of which Knowles and Arsenault are also graduates, although they studied there after the college moved to its shiny new campus in King’s Cross), there was still a sense of the specters of fashion history returning to haunt its corridors once again.\\xa0Not least due to Knowles's and Arsenault’s willingness to pay homage to some of their heroes, many of whom once studied in the now-cobwebbed rooms they showed in—at a preview appointment, they reeled off a wider list of designers from Azzedine Alaïa to John Galliano. “We were looking at what fashion used to be, and what it became when we started, and where it's now going—and where we want to go with it,” said Arsenault. Added Knowles, “It feels like a very elegant space. And this season feels quite elegant to me.”Elegant it was, but it still retained that signature high-octane Knwls energy and grit. Models strutted and vamped and twirled in an opening series of looks that showcased the duo’s remarkable corsetry skills—warping treated leathers into artfully cinched and strapped waists, or gray terry tracksuits transformed into cropped hoodies and swishy, high-waisted pants—as well as their deft hand for a bias cut, whether in delicately-printed slip dresses with tendrils of fabric fluttering behind as the models walked, or a series of more ladylike gowns, including one that was embroidered with floral beading. (But still sheer: this is the Knwls woman, after all.)\\xa0As for that sense of elegance? There was the playful touch of a series of helmet-like leather fascinators, hovering over models’ heads like a beetle’s carapace. (The hats were made by the legendary milliner Stephen Jones, who came backstage last season to introduce himself to the designers and let them know he was a fan of their work.) Elsewhere, the duo found themselves looking back to the golden age of couture, with jackets featuring generously proportioned shoulders that referenced Balenciaga’s cocoon coat, or gathered crepe dresses that took their cues from Madame Grès. “It’s a twist on her style, though,” Arsenault cautioned, lest we take the comparison too literally. “It’s in washed fabrics, and tight and revealing, and done with liquid jerseys and florals and spliced-up dresses and these Alaia-inspired hooded dresses, so it’s more of a twist on her style.”\\xa0In a final nod to the fashion greats there was a bridal look to close the show—but once again seen sideways, through the Knwls lens. With the boning of the corset constructed by Knowles herself, it was an object lesson in the questions the pair have been considering about how to take their reverence for fashion history and bring it into the future. The techniques to make the wedding dress may be centuries old, but with its lingerie-inspired details and the Tencel fabric train that trailed behind it, this was very much a wedding dress for the 2025 bride. “I think last season we tried to make it feel more mature in a very literal way, by keeping the styling very pared-back,” Knowles added. “So this season, we wanted to take that energy and make it feel more rich, and full. To go back to what Knwls is all about, with the layering and the detail and the sensuality to it.” On that, they firmly succeeded.\", 'This season, Kozaburo Akasaka photographed his lookbook images in and around Canal Street on a cool—and it must be said, hot—cast of characters that includes both friends and people he admires. “Until now I’ve been kind of focusing on the visual representation and styling as things that are more out of this world,” he explained during an appointment at a friend’s studio that he had temporarily taken over. That’s the friend wearing the Hex sashiko “denim”-style jacket and matching pleated trousers in the first look. “But I see my friends wearing the clothes, so I kind of wanted to capture this moment in New York.”As it turns out, grounding his clothes in real life served to elevate their desirability—in the designer’s meticulous creative process it can sometimes get lost that he makes clothes to be lived-in, not to be saved for precious special occasions. Take the aforementioned honeycomb Sashiko group, which is available in four different colors, each achieved through a different natural hand-dyeing process in his native Japan. Whipping out an iPad full of videos of the dyeing in-progress, he explained the painstaking steps through which the colors are achieved. “It’s funny because I’m from Japan, but as I go out of the country I learn more about our history—I didn’t know that we had a rich history in botanical dyeing colors. It was also part of kimono culture, which is in decline; the amount of craftsmen now is 3% of what it used to be in its heyday.”It does not make for inexpensive clothing, that’s for sure, but there’s a clear one-to-one relationship between its process and the final product. Supporting a centuries-old tradition with silhouettes that are timeless but never boring is also a kind of sustainability approach. “Some people say this material is quite heavy for spring, but for me it’s more about its longevity,” he added. Elsewhere there were lightweight cottons, a similarly lightweight cardigan knitted to resemble snake scales, and, of course, Kozaburo’s signature denim separates. A Western shirt with a leather trim was an absolute highlight.', 'For spring, JJ Martin elevated La DoubleJ’s presentation to a whole new level. She took over Milan’s Circolo Filologico, transforming it into what she described as a “high-vibration Fashion Week station and portal to higher consciousness,” offering editors, buyers, and the now globally expanded LDJ sisterhood a five-hour “energy bath” filled with sessions led by some of their most cherished healers. Come for the clothes, stay for the spiritual healing.Although the prospect was enticing, finding time for even a brief five-minute chakra realignment amid the whirlwind of shows and presentations proved challenging—at least for this reviewer. Still, the intention behind it was remarkable, and those lucky enough to manage to attend left in a state of enviable calm.The collection amplified the event’s already-uplifting atmosphere, brimming with La DoubleJ’s mood-boosting prints and vibrant colorways. Embracing an even more maximalist approach than usual, Martin heightened the energy by experimenting with intricate embroideries, lace intarsia, and broderie anglaise. Patterns symbolized sacred geometry, with each designed for its energetic properties. Floral motifs were selected for their hidden meanings—the iris symbolizing positivity and the zinnia representing endurance and friendship. Like amulets of goodwill, LDJ’s frocks are designed not just to be worn but also to have emotional resonance; they radiate optimism and joy. Not many other clothes give off the same aura.', 'Here in London, fashion’s ongoing love affair with the football world shows no sign of fading. Proof of that came this afternoon courtesy of Labrum, which showed in one of the most impressive locations of the week: The Emirates Stadium, home of the Arsenal Football Club, one of the sport’s true titans. While sitting pitchside, looking out onto stands draped with flags representing the Gunners’ myriad fan bases around the world—Singapore Gooners, Persian Gulf Gunners, and Arsenal Liberia among them—you couldn’t help but be reminded of how football, one of Britain’s greatest cultural institutions, would be a pale imitation of what it is without the contributions of a truly global array of athletes who have migrated to the UK to work.That wasn’t necessarily the intention behind the choice to show here. Foday Dumbuya, Labrum’s creative director, is a lifelong Arsenal fan, and the opportunity to take over one of England’s largest stadiums was a generous progression of the brand’s collaboration with the football club. Indeed, a couple of months back, Labrum was tapped by Arsenal and Adidas, its uniform sponsor, to design the official away kits for the season ahead. Still, there was a poetic resonance with the message at the label’s heart, which was powerfully underscored in a show-prefacing spoken-word performance by British rapper Ghetts. “Designed by an immigrant; defined by resilience,” he said, his words ricocheting in the stadium’s round.“It’s something I’ve been talking about for years, but I wanted to really bring that to life here,” Dumbaya said postshow in the players’ tunnel. “We’re committed to celebrating the beautiful work that immigrants do and that they continue to do in this part of the world.” The collection’s baseline was a synthesis of the expressive, richly textured codes of West African dress (both Dumbuya and his stylist, Ib Kamara, hail from Sierra Leone) with the rigor of British sartorial codes. Tailoring was a strong suit. A double-breasted navy ensemble with a lace-up placket was sported by Declan Rice, one of Arsenal’s star midfielders, along with Labrum’s hefty-soled interpretation of the Adidas Superstar. The standout pieces in the category, though, were the louche lounge suits cut in a heavy-duty fil coupe–esque cloth, with fuzzy cowrie shell motifs in ivory and ochre. Elsewhere, the shells themselves were woven into hoodlike headdresses, invoking their historical function as a currency in precolonial West African societies. “Labrum is all about educating and bringing these histories to life,” Dumbuya explained of the emblem. “I wanted to highlight the value of diversity and bringing cultures together.”Another key theme explored here was movement. That may sound like a given for a collection presented on a football pitch, but the movement in question was the passage of bodies across borders. That was nodded to by wrap dresses, jumpsuits, and a billowing caftan in a jacquard that reproduced the stamps in Dumbaya’s mother’s old passport, but the most intriguing riffs on the theme were expressed through deft patternmaking. Airy woven shirts, sculptural canvas jackets, and trench coats were crafted with zips at the sleeve, or had sleeves entirely detached and refastened with eyelets pierced by stainless steel rings. Dumbaya’s intention, he explained, was to create pieces that not only transitioned between seasons but places too. “For example, if you’re in West Africa, you’re going to want those sleeves,” he explained, “so you can unzip them for a sense of freedom. It was about trying to find juxtapositions between ways of dressing in the West and in Africa, and finding ways to express them in the same garment.”', \"Many of the models at Lacoste carried bunches of keys: what was that about? “The idea was to ask yourself what you might find in your grandfather’s attic. If you found an old steamer trunk, what would be those little artifacts from the past?” Pelagia Kolotouros’s rhetorical questions nicely encapsulated her self-appointed task at this peak piqué producer of crocodile logo tennis-based sportswear: to use the founder René Lacoste as an inspirational key in order to unlock design that takes the brand he founded into a new territory: lifestyle.After many seasons, Lacoste now seems set on producing its runway collections in earnest. The amount of well-followed individuals at this show wearing boxfresh Lacoste—many also carrying croc-embossed bags apparently heaped with more goodies from some gifting suite—were almost too many to seat in the front row their outfits were meant to grace. Kolotouros warmed up with some looks that were meant to reflect her sense of off-duty René: backless sectioned vests and high-waisted short-shorts that echoed images she’d seen of the founder at the beach in the 1920s.The designer hit her stride with some interesting collisions between the formality of sportswear of the same period and the fabrics for which Lacoste is best known (crocodile apart). Viscose-spiked piqué was an ace fabric for her roomy suiting, along with a semi-tattered terry toweling that resembled an appealingly unprecious boucle. If these pieces were her killer forehand, then the backhand equivalent were the three styles of tracksuit—so contemporary suiting—in elevated fabrics. The curve at the back of a track jacket cut in black sateen and lemon yellow leather was especially on (match) point. Bags incorporating side panels of tennis netting or shaped as the section of a pleated tennis skirt were tricksily cute. Shirts featuring mega-croc prints were easy hits—but when you can take them, you play them. For Kolotouros, precisely understanding what question she wants her version of Lacoste to answer will be the key to leveling up this brand: if she hasn't quite unlocked it yet, she is certainly knocking on the door.\", 'For spring 2025, Lafayette 148’s Emily Smith took us inside an artist’s studio. “Spring is synonymous with new beginnings, and drawing is sort of the birth of every creative thing,” she explained at the presentation held in a Manhattan loft. The Lafayette 148 team had zeroed in specifically on the act of figure drawing with charcoal; the sinuous style lines that are first laid down on paper became fringe details across the bodice of a simple long-sleeve maxidress; the dust that comes off a charcoal pencil inspired a subtle curvilinear jacquard pattern; and most importantly, the smudges created when a hand brushes against a drawing were turned into a spectacular print on a suit and trench coat. What made the latter so special was that the print was specifically placed on the garment; big swipes of color—jutting across buttonholes on the bottom of a tuxedo jacket worn with matching pajama pants or wrapping around the trench—were made without any side seams so that the swooping lines would remain unbroken.Other inspiration came from the beautiful chaos that exists inside a studio. The half-finished drawings and inspiration images tacked on the walls were the basis for a cream knit sweater with hand-knitted embellished flaps and a simple A-line dress with a sweetheart neckline covered in small squares of fabric, like a mosaic, in shades of beige, white, blue, orange, and yellow. The color palette was subdued: a pale chalk yellow and a shade of blue borrowed from charcoal paper. Another highlight in the collection was a long jacquard dress with a textured fil coupé in a shade of pencil gray and chalk yellow that was meant to emulate charcoal dust but mostly had really enchanting textural appeal.', 'Sally LaPointe wanted to break the internet for her spring 2025 collection. Instead of putting on a runway show, she got the icon Oprah Winfrey to be her muse for the season.While Oprah may seem like an untraditional model for LaPointe, the talk show host has been a loyal supporter of the brand since she first discovered it during the pandemic. “I had it in my gut that Oprah was going to say yes to being my muse for this collection,” explained LaPointe. “The reason for having her be my muse was that she epitomizes everything the collection is about. She’s like that strong, empowered female who wants to look put together but not too overdone and be comfortable.” LaPointe chose her strongest 11 looks from this season to showcase on the host and took well-loved, familiar pieces that she’s worn before but gave a spring 2025 update in new colorways. She also took some trendier pieces like baggy jeans and had Winfrey style them in the LaPointe way in a sequined sheer top that crops in the front and cascades in the back like a cape. Winfrey also sported one of LaPointe’s favorite bodysuits that the designer wears daily and paired it with fun pieces like a sequined skirt and a sheer trench, proving that these clothes are meant for all ages and body types.Though LaPointe may skew to a younger audience, the designer wants you to know that the brand is for all ages. Not only is it sold on some of the trendier e-commerce retailers like Net-a-Porter and FWRD, it’s also on classics like Neiman. For LaPointe, highlighting her pieces on Oprah was a way to show that her label is also for real women and not just the Insta-it girls.', 'Many designers have a trench coat in their oeuvre. Whether it’s a standard khaki version we’ve seen a million times or a more inventive, stylized take, the piece is often designed with everyday practicality in mind: It’s a good piece to have when it’s chilly, rainy, or both—a sophisticated alternative to a yellow rubber raincoat. But LaQuan Smith had a more specific use in mind when adding a trench to his spring 2025 collection. “My theory of a transparent trench coat always goes to the woman who, [on] a rainy night, is going to her man’s house to have makeup sex—or something like that,” Smith said in his Long Island City office and atelier the day before his show. Adding to that inspiration is an equally provocative fabric: “This is a new technique that my Italian mills have been working on. It’s a transparent horse.”This all tracks for the Queens-born designer, as “the ultimate LaQuan Smith woman is all about glamour and sensuality and things that are quite provocative and modern,” he said. For years, this woman has mostly sought out Smith’s three top sellers: bodysuits, catsuits, and dresses—many of the sheer, cutout, skintight variety. But as he did last season, Smith built on that foundation here in an effort to dress that woman 24/7, not just when she’s en route to a party (or a late-night liaison with her lover).“What does a LaQuan Smith woman look like during the day?” the designer asked rhetorically. She’s wearing khaki, safari-inspired separates, like a jacket with front pockets and an open, lace-up back or low-slung, wide-leg trousers paired with a bodysuit. “I’ve been obsessed with this argyle cutout concept,” Smith said of fashioning this season’s bodysuits, which come in brown and white lace. During our walkthrough, when a model emerged in a strapless bleached-denim gown with a very high slit, Smith noted, “This is my girl in the Hamptons. She’s hosting for the weekend.” She probably owns the collection’s mini denim dress, too, padded at the hips to give what Smith describes as “a BBL effect.” (The latter is a very cute dress, but the fit needs to be slightly adjusted, as it was seen on the runway with a horizontal pucker.)Though known for his severe designs, come the night of Smith’s show, frilly organza miniskirts with matching button-up blouses seemingly floated down the runway. The airy pieces, he said the day before, were a nod to what Smith considers the ultimate luxury: sleep. Through his Samsung partnership, he’s become obsessed with tracking his through the brand’s Galaxy Ring, which he gifted each of his seated show attendees.And about that show. It was held at a sprawling, industrial event space in Bushwick, with the soundtrack of hits like Gwen Stefani’s “Hollaback Girl” as high-octane as Carine Roitfeld’s styling. (A neon ostrich-feather jacket over a navel-exposing, plunging-V black dress, anyone?) When Winnie Harlow appeared in the transparent trench, a front row that included Mary J. Blige, Ferg, Camila Cabello, Honey Balenciaga, and Lil Durk erupted in applause. The same contingent shouted words of encouragement (“You got this, girl!”) when a model’s stiletto got tangled in her lace duster.The 50-look collection could have benefited from an edit. Menswear pieces like silk drawstring pants and a blazer with oversized lapels got lost, as did the swimwear, which was hard to discern from the bodysuits (though the pieces can be worn as both). And though Smith technically doesn’t do bridal, there was a lot of white in the collection. Not all of it felt necessary, but maybe that was part of the point? “I’m just not a basic person,” he said the day before. No one can argue with that.', '“Being soft when things are hard.” Lauren Manoogian’s approach to her dreamy new collection is a fitting description for the overall vibe of the spring 2025 season in New York, where flou prevailed and air was the predominant element. The designer said she was “really focusing on having lightness,” with knits and wovens both. That quality was present in the twisted “I-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud” Cupro skirts and dresses, which were an evolution from her resort season’s bubbles. Among the most weighless of the knits were the pointelles, a few of which patchworked all the different stitches together. Manoogian referred to a group of tiered pieces made of a fine, almost translucent Mercerized cotton as “the veil group.” These wafted around the body. “The motion element of the collection is more and more important,” noted her partner Chris Fireoved.More gestural were draped pieces made using a partial knitting technique. Complementing these were compact ruched knits that puckered a bit like seersucker, Manoogian noted. Most romantic, with a Pre-Raphaelite prettiness, and perhaps most representative of what the designer called her “delicate mindset,” were cotton linen Modal dresses and separates whose texture was created with elastic.Drawstrings, which can be used to customize fit, were applied to a group of pima cotton and linen pieces, including a long vest and wide-cropped pants, with simple ’80s-ish geometric silhouettes. Adding weight to the offering were knits made using cut strips of cotton. Denim is a newish category; she showed a pair of jeans with a generous draped leg, a neat little chore outfit, and a smart car coat.This Manoogian collection was defined by a certain delicacy. It just so happens that the designer’s inner state is a mirror of what’s happening on the outside. “Somehow,” she said, “there’s a little bit of fragility happening, and tenderness and nostalgia.”', \"Lela Rose has the following goal in life: “To give people clothing that they can see wearing in a lot of different ways—but they're fully dressed,” she said. “I’m dedicated to always being dressed no matter where you are, no matter what you're doing.”This season, she was dressing people for a hypothetical outdoor dinner party. Rose loves to entertain al fresco (so much so that she has a Rizzoli book, Fresh Air Affairs) and wanted to make elegant outfits to do it in:  A red gingham knit dress mimicked the pattern of a picnic, and a top had bold stripes akin to the rows of a freshly mowed lawn. Americana colors were mixed in with earthy hues—a palette Rose, who lives in Jackson Hole, believes mimics a Wyoming summer: “It's the colors of living in the West,” she said.Another motif for this collection was the tulip. Inspired by the floral still lifes of Dutch artist Leendert Blok, the tulip was a bold silhouette on a colorblocked dress and a subtle embroidery on a lace gown. A scarlet top, meanwhile, evoked the shape of petals.Yet it’s not just the flowers seen in Dutch art that she was taken with. It was the whole ambience: “I love how in old Dutch paintings, ladies were dressed to the nines,” she said. And with this new collection of mostly formal looks, perhaps for Rose’s customers life will begin to imitate art.\", 'The fashion crowd after these shows often reacts with a swoon combined with imagining that, in a parallel world, we might all be dressed in Lemaire. The brand even plays into this, conjuring a conceptual sidewalk within its Place des Vosges premises, where models appear like poised city types exiting a building, pausing mid-stroll, or encountering another character en route.Even while Christophe Lemaire and Sarah-Linh Tran have this narrative down pat and know their audience is comprised of admirers, they still build upon their repertoire, finding new ways to express the language of Lemaire. This collection, said Tran, was about straightforward silhouettes, “long and lean, easy to understand.” The noted how the photographs of August Sander informed their opening black-and-white archetypes—the men’s white button-front V-neck under a black ensemble and overcoat, for example. But the designers also have a thoroughly contemporary eye, as if considering that one of those portraits today might feature a young woman in a liquid-like dress adorned with beaded body jewelry, or a guy projecting an urban-western vibe, his black shirt pierced with small rings.The lineup’s softly tailored ensembles, often in nuanced tones of moss and bark, will particularly resonate for Parisians and people elsewhere who have endured a season of un-springlike weather. Here, you start the day shielded by a leather jacket and different weights of gabardine and poplin and finish by peeling open a shirt to expose the shoulder. The duo also continues to design coats with inner straps that transform outerwear into a kind of shoulder accessory. In two instances, they created volume around a knit minidress integrated with another kind of strap: garters that held up matching thigh-highs. Lemaire has an innate sensuality, but this felt cheeky: Pretty Woman in the era of quiet luxury.The show’s shift towards dusty colors—coordinating pieces in a captivating blue gray, a romantic ruched dress in peony—coincided with a print series featuring the pencil crayon drawings of chairs and other objects by Philippe Weisbecker. Along with bags that boasted braided details and removable jewelry elements and asymmetric sandals dubbed ‘Picasso,’ the art and craft layers brought even more interest to the collection. Lemaire, meanwhile, downplayed their talents. “We can only do half the job and then someone has to wear it and make it look stylish.” That they do most of the job is what keeps those stylish customers coming back.', 'The Constitution was a hot topic on the opening day of New York Fashion Week. Bookending Friday was the CFDA/Vogue Fashion for Our Future March and printouts of the actual document on seats at Willy Chavarria. In between, Libertine’s Johnson Hartig exercised his First Amendment rights when he appeared at the end of his show leading a parade of models and holding a sign that read “Save the Garden.” “We’re thrilled to be here in the gardens today doing our part to bring awareness; we’re just hoping it’s not too late,” he said.The little piece of Eden in question is the Elizabeth Street Garden, which is in danger of being demolished to make way for housing developments. Hartig’s choice of music, Joni Mitchell’s “Big Yellow Taxi,” with the lyric “They paved paradise and put up a parking lot / With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot” was a stroke of genius in that it referenced the possible fate of the garden and one of two tropical-colored prints, one depicting a swanky California hotel with a Hockney-like pool and the other the New York skyline. These patterns served as a reminder that in bringing his collections from Los Angeles to the Big Apple, Hartig is creating a sort of bridge across America.Yet it wasn’t building, but growing, that was on Hartig’s agenda, which was hinted at by the seed packets left for each guest. “My earliest memories are gardening with my dad,” said the green-thumbed designer, who has carried on the tradition at his own home. The most direct references to the fruits of the soil were garments with roses of meticulously placed rhinestone appliqués. The season’s ditzy floral print was most effective when further embellished with dimensional lilies of the valley. Less literal was a series of striped pieces that were prettily disrupted through patchworking or embroidery or being turned inside out. These were all tailored garments and had slightly more of a roll-up-your-sleeves feeling—especially when accessorized with a watering can, spade, or wheelbarrow—than many of the other looks that seemed destined for swanky, upscale events.Among them was a coral-printed caftan shown with coordinating coral-embellished sunnies, and a cropped jacket with dimensional Georgian and Edwardian lover’s eyes. This was shown with shorts and was one of the designer’s new silhouettes, which was developed with the brand’s growing group of younger customers in mind. Ditto the rather glittering jeans and jean jackets that were more glam rock than boho. A cardigan suit in a delicious shade of mango felt ’80s by way of the ’60s, and beautiful caftans had flou and a hostess vibe.Reading between the lines, it seemed like one of Hartig’s goals was to chase the youth vote, with options that were “fresh, new, and energetic.” A celebration of one’s salad days, in other words. He succeeded in terms of shapes—the shorter jackets were a welcome addition to the lineup—and in invigorating the label’s denim category. Yet the collection would have benefited if it had hewed a bit closer to the philosophy from which the brand takes its name. Beautiful and accomplished as the designs were, they felt collectible rather than high-spirited, unconventional, and free.', 'Looking at the images of Lii’s spring 2025 collection, you might be surprised to learn the inspiration was Michael Haneke movies. “The characters are in a very formal or very intense space, but then somehow there’s a breakthrough or a break point that basically becomes the plot of the movie,” designer Zane Li said in the Chinatown studio where he showed his collection. “I’m really attracted by the intensity of people in a formal location or in a formal space, so I thought, Okay, let’s think about how to undo eveningwear.”The look book opened with a sort of bandeau-cape, which is Li’s version of the classic fur shrug. Except in this case, he took the shape of a T-shirt and connected the sleeves to wrap around the body. It might sound like a piece of clothing that is “not functional,” but the minute you slip it on, it forces you to adapt the sort of formal stance of wearing a shrug, and then suddenly it all clicks—it’s the same as balancing a pashmina about your arms as you walk around a dinner party, arms extended in perpetual glamour.A simple shift dress the color of a beige file folder seemed to be half-floating in front of a model’s body. It wasn’t a styling trick but a dress with one sleeve, except the other sleeve was still present and left open at the shoulder seam. Underneath was layered a black top with a similar yet opposing design; instead of leaving the shoulder seam open, Li created a long loop that connects the two. Meanwhile, on a simple geometric dress with spaghetti straps, the back extended like an upside-down shark fin, but it was just the classic cowl back of an evening gown made from a stiffer fabric that provides more dramatic results (it could also be worn the regular way).Another short-sleeve dress had a cutout at the waist, with a wide panel tied around the waist that created a kind of cowl-neck effect, which was sort of mirrored by the way the fabric on the bodice hung over the belt. Although in photographs Li’s clothes might seem like complicated garments with zero real-life utility, they are, in fact, things you can just literally throw on and go, often made from cotton and other technical and sporty fabrics perfect for living. Li has already done all the thinking in his design, adding as much impact as he can while simultaneously subtracting everything unnecessary so that you don’t have to think about anything when getting dressed.Such is the magic of Li’s work; in only two collections he has managed to create an incredibly deep visual vocabulary that feels modern and exciting but also harks back to the last vestiges of our pre-millennium tension before 9/11, before the complete dominance of the internet, before AI. Like a purer vision of a future that never quite arrived, but maybe now, we can have it after all.', 'Jonathan Anderson rounded off his decade at Loewe with a show in the round. It began with a bouncingly light, flowered, off-the-shoulder crinoline dress, whose visible underhoops were also circular. Intake of breath: Corseting-free and hands in pockets, the models zipped around in two-tone oxfords and oversized, silver-mirrored aviators, for all the world as casually as if they were wearing sweatshirts and jeans.Anderson was about to mess with classicism, the relevance of old couture crafts, fashion realism, trompe l’oeil, and pop culture in the modern world: In essence, all the ways he’s been progressing and elevating since he joined Loewe 10 years ago at the tender age of 30. He’d sent an antique-looking gilded silver ring engraved with the brand’s name as a souvenir with every invitation. “I wanted this idea of something circular. The ring is circular,” he said.There was no elaborately constructed set this time. Only a single artwork by Tracey Emin stood in the center—a narrow pole with a little, ordinary bird perched on top cast in bronze. As the press release observed of its significance: “Caught in a moment of pause, she encourages us to imagine imminent flight, and ultimately its freedom.”So there we were, seated in a stripped-back arena of benches in a white box, from which to spectate upon nothing but his clothes. Out came a visual deluge of high skills and crisp editing. Mind-bending references to classical composers and painters on T-shirts—made, scarcely believably, in feathers—pictured Mozart, Chopin, Bach, Van Gogh’s Sunflowers, and a Manet soldier boy. “I like this idea that they’re kind of like pinup rock stars,” Anderson said. “Like when you go to a museum or you go to a concert: experiential things that you want to take a memento of with you. The idea that music reminds us of moments in our lives.”Then there were his multiple reimagined French golden age couture dresses, all hoops and semisheer flower prints and trapeze-line silhouettes abbreviated to teeny-tiny minis. It’s been a long time since a fashion designer has taken on the grandeur of event dressing, respected the beauty and joy of it, and yet shown such a delightfully unpainful way to wear it—with sneakers. “I think it’s interesting when you strip out the fussiness,” Anderson said.There was no sense that this was a 10-year retrospective of Anderson’s work at Loewe. But then again, the imprint of what he’s done for the formerly little-known Spanish leather house was all over the collection. It emanated maturity, modernity, and a calm ownership of sophisticated tailoring—blazers over elegantly draped voluminous trousers; classic leather coats carved with a turned-up fillip in the hem. This quite apart from creating all the commercial catnip signatures—ultra-desirable bags and the Ballet Runner logo sneakers—that are recognized and wanted by every girl and her mother worldwide.That is a massive achievement, one that brought Anderson a standing ovation, a massed round of applause from his designer peers Sarah Burton, Nicolas Di Felice, Kris Van Assche, Pieter Mulier, and Adrian Appiolaza, as well as Delphine Arnault and all of Anderson’s actor friends in the house.', 'Loro Piana shows its men’s and women’s collections intermingled on mannequins. Walking through the crowd of strikingly styled and hat-heavy—especially in womenswear—static ensembles today we heard how these collections majored on linen, and saw some interesting fabrications. It turns out if you mix linen with cashmere in an undyed cable knit cardigan, its hand-feel retains more of the flaxy hardiness of the vegetal softness of the animal. Linen was elsewhere blended with Manila hemp—a banana plant—or used in handsome triple-bonded summer raincoat cut for both genders. There were linen-silk blends, twisted linens, and linen flower prints.Linen’s most appealing properties include moisture absorption and breathability. Once you breathed a little and instead of trying to absorb the full spectrum of this Loro Piana–verse focused on picking out individual garments—imaginary shopping, basically—today’s presentation became breezier. Womenswear highlights included a gorgeously finished leather field jacket that would have looked delightful over some washed LP denim and a vintage martini-print silk shirt. A highly impressive embroidered and shaved cashmere jacket in a ribbed liner shape looked like a wonderful vintage piece.In menswear a placket fronted suede-collared country jacket— inevitably in treated linen—and a linen-silk (I think) pale herringbone peak-collared suit and shirt were amongst the many fine items. There was a wonderful tweedish looking linen top coat and an irregular oaty melange pattern: However, worn over a gray birds eye work waistcoat, round neck sweater, tie, shirt and double-pleat flannel pant, it looked more 1950s country doctor than 2020s luxury connoisseur. The styling here was too total and too fusty.Past a display of handsome new sunglass styles in Japanese acetate was a room packed with bags that included a cashmere(ish) to the touch nubuck tote lined in real cashmere and a rather small drawstring backpack. The most exciting detail was shown between that room and the next room’s archive of Loro Piana printed scarves: Looped from the shoulder of another mannequin was a leather strap whose two buckles were tied into the corners of one of those silk scarves to fashion an ad hoc handbag. That seemed like a pretty interesting way of wearing a “bag” that could be renewed every time the customer acquired a new scarf.', '“I think if you don’t put yourself in aesthetic danger every season, you’re not playing the game of fashion.” Nicolas Ghesquière made that memorable remark on a recent episode of Vogue’s The Run-Through podcast. It was a fitting summation of the often exquisite Louis Vuitton collection he presented tonight in a show that capped off his 10th-anniversary celebrations at the house.Ghesquière was off on another time-traveling trip, this one to the Renaissance, an era he said he feels personally connected to, having grown up in France’s Loire Valley with its centuries-old chateaux. The collection opened with a group of jackets—all puffed sleeves, pulled-in waists, and peplum hems—but the biker shorts and chunky leather sandals they were worn with brought them back to the here and now. So did the supple construction of what would have been in the past very ponderous coats.He liked the idea of developing the architectural shapes he prefers but with a lighter hand and a fluidity in make. “The game,” he explained, “was to work with the two ateliers—there’s flou and there’s tailleur—and we break boundaries. It’s a contraction, to build these clothes with as much detail and structure, letting go of gravity somehow.”Subsequent looks married breeches with roomy blouson jackets and/or drop-waist ribbed knit dresses, and Ghesquière challenged his team to cut coats that look and feel more like blouses. “The lightness of the silk fabric is very alive,” he said. “What I really wanted is that you couldn’t put a name on these pieces.” The day/evening divide would’ve been slippery too, but for the lavishing of embellishments, like the cabochons dotting loose-fitting tops worn with his take on the transparent pantaloons that have become one of the season’s breakout trends.The stars of the show came at the end. They were a trio of unstructured jackets featuring paintings by the French artist Laurent Grasso from his series Studies Into the Past, on which he inserts modern celestial and atmospheric phenomenon into works rendered in the style of the Renaissance greats. It’s hard to imagine a more fitting artistic collaborator.Ghesquière mentioned one more challenge he’d set himself: the creation of a “generational” bag, meaning, it seems, an everyday sort of style with a casual cool in contrast to the preciousness of the clothes. Pictured in Look 1 and 2, it follows the rules of his game: Where most LV bags are structured, this one has the “soft power” he was after.', \"On a sunny Sunday in September, the LoveShackFancy showroom is abuzz. Yesterday, singer Lana Del Rey walked into their store on New York’s Bleecker Street and bought one of their halter dresses. Within hours, paparazzi photographed her wearing it to Karen Elson’s wedding.It was a surprise to the brand’s founder, Rebecca Hessel Cohen. But it wasn’t surprising: LoveShackFancy started in 2010 after Cohen designed the bridesmaid dresses for her own wedding. Her friends then asked her if she could make custom designs for them, too. Fast forward 14 years—and 17 stores—and Loveshackfancy dresses can be spotted everywhere from Bridgehampton to Belgravia. Hyper-feminine events dressing? It’s what they were meant for.The timing of Del Rey’s debut was also stylishly serendipitous. The brand’s spring 2025 collection was an ode to its wedding season roots, introducing a number of styles designed with nuptial guests in mind. There were silk cut bias midis adorned with delicate floral prints, baby blue taffeta gowns decorated with bows. Others had an on-trend boho air: a powder blue dress with billowing long sleeves, another in rose cut in flowy, diaphanous silk. (For those walking down the aisle, Cohen included something for you too: her salon style runway show closed with a bride in a white chiffon dress with chantilly lace.) “I live for weddings. I live for love. Love love,” said Cohen.She found inspiration for this collection after visiting Christian Dior’s atelier and apartment in Paris, designed by Victor Grandpierre. (Look closely at her moodboard, and you’ll see photoshopped images of LoveShackFancy models at Christian Dior shows in the 1950s and 1960s.) The city’s legendary flea markets, too, proved fruitful for her fashion: one pink dress with bow embroidery was inspired by a satin sheet set she found from the 1930s.However, LoveShackFancy doesn’t have a store in Paris (yet). So much of the collection was meant for women that shop the various high-end main streets of America: a pale blue cropped moto jacket in leather with ruffle detailing felt destined for the Kemo Sabe hat wearing influencers of Aspen (where LoveShackFancy open a store in 2025). Flouncy floral mini dresses, meanwhile, will likely be a coveted party look for the teen girls of Charleston and Texas. Many of the clothes this season came in what Cohen described as sorbet colors and fall just above the ankles. (“Tea length for a tea party,” she said).Cohen may describe her clothes as existing in the la-la-land worlds of Alice in Wonderland or Dior’s 16th arrondissement. But she’s making them for reality: ”We’re thinking about what's going on in the spring—Easter, graduation, weddings, all the galas,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone.Then back to that fantasy: “She’s ready for her debutante ball in Paris!” Cohen added, giddy, as she pointed to a pink gown with rose appliqués and a train.\", \"The spring 2025 Luar show took place outdoors at Rockefeller Plaza. To set the proper mood, the back part of two cars filled with chucheros flanked the runway on either end. A chuchero is a box that contains multiple speakers, subwoofers, and other equipment that turn cars into heart-attack inducing sound machines. In the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, this “sport” is known as voceteo. The proof that they were legit is the amount of editors that jumped out of their seats when the first sounds pumped through the speakers. The music, a melange of techno, booming bass, and maybe even a Nine Inch Nails sample, didn't let up one second during the whole show.The chucheros made sense both as a tie to his designer Raul López’s Dominican roots, but also as a modern iteration of punk attitudes. (What's more punk than blasting your music at ungodly volumes to stake a claim for your own self-made culture?) The starting point for this collection was the designer’s life during the late ’90s and early aughts when he was still a teenager trying to square his life at home in Brooklyn with his Dominican family and friends with the world he was encountering when he would venture to the Lower East Side to hang out. “I was all teen angst and trying to figure out who I was, hanging out with the punk girls, the crazy girls, and the art girls downtown but I was still dressing like my family wanted to,” he explained a day before the show at his Wall Street studio. “I needed to have a skinny pant to hang with the girls, but then I could wear a button up to be with my family… my hair could have a nice little bang.” You know, the asymmetric kind we all wore back then. “I was in my punk era, being rebellious.”Although López referenced New York Dolls and CBGB’s and the traditional NYC punk scene that we’re all familiar with, this was not a carbon copy homage with mohawks, studs, and safety pins. “Punk is a feeling, it’s an attitude, it’s how you present yourself out of the norm and stand out and be you,” he said.\", 'When Vogue broke the news last week that Ludovic de Saint Sernin will be the eighth guest designer to create a season of Jean Paul Gaultier Haute Couture, he said that his own collection would deliver new ideas despite the decision to skip a runway show.In a whitewashed gallery in the Marais, he elaborated on what this entails. “We want to build the structure to support our growth. We don’t want to be everywhere and then can’t sustain the growth,” the designer said. “We have been working with people like Dua Lipa, Sabrina Carpenter, and Troye Sivan, who are performing a lot, and we’re thinking about the garments in such a different way.”Cue BDSM Ballet, a pretty accurate description of the two main influences, laced together tightly, just like de Saint Sernin’s best-selling bralettes and briefs. The accompanying photos, taken by Adam Peter Johnson, feature models who convincingly double as dancers—just dressed up and off-duty—exuding the kind of angel-demon tension of Black Swan, which inspired the designer alongside the choreography of Pina Bausch.While one cannot escape that a collection alluding to dance deserved a show, de Saint Sernin’s explorations of eroticism translate across performance and photography, as evidenced by last season’s special runway show in New York that was an homage to Robert Mapplethorpe (created in partnership with the artist’s foundation). Here, de Saint Sernin introduced flounced and tiered volumes in tulle and softer fabrics slung low on the hips, babydoll dresses, and gilets in actual feathers or textured wool “mille-feuille.”There were highly streamlined ideas: Slinky dresses that knotted across and dipped low down the décolletage were made of a jersey from Japan (where de Saint Sernin sources nearly all his fabrics) that had the transparency of semisheer tights. More elaborate pieces, like a crystal lattice bolero or a top made from a single square of leather, boasted nearly 1,400 eyelets placed by hand (a more commercial version will have them hot-fixed). Most impressive was a sculptural dress composed of eyelet trims uncoiling around the body—like a descendant of Alaïa’s famous zipper dress, only the bands were more staggered and suspended by invisible threads. And while chaps may not qualify as sculptural, let’s say they provide a peek at what de Saint Sernin may propose as his men’s looks for Gaultier. For both men and women, collared shirts and micro-shorts topped with either a suede blouson or trench reemphasized his everyday, gender-fluid allure.Unsurprisingly, de Saint Sernin said he would love to design ballet costumes, and it certainly felt as though he was manifesting his next marquee moment. “It’s the dream to have these projects outside of fashion,” he said. As for the eye-catching eyelet ballerina shoes, they were from a collaboration LdSS did early on with Repetto, perhaps due for an encore.', 'Having hit London, New York, and LA since launching his brand just four years ago, Barcelona-born designer Luis de Javier made his Paris debut as Fashion Week got underway, at the Espace Niemeyer way up in the 19th arrondissement. A line snaked around the block well before start time. The kids knew something was up: In the fashion biz, finding a mentor like Riccardo Tisci is rarer than a blue moon. And something worth standing in the rain for.Backstage, de Javier described meeting Tisci at a party in LA. “It was like a movie. He told me that 20 years ago he was in exactly my position and all it took was one person who believed in him. And he said, ‘I’m going to be that person for you,’” he recalled. Fast forward to this season, and the enormity of showing in the City of Light sent de Javier into homage mode, including to his own viral hit from his February 2023 New York show. (“The only way to face it is to take it by the horns,” he quipped).His compatriot from couture’s golden era, Cristóbal Balenciaga, was first on the tribute list. Christian Dior’s New Look and Madame Grès’s art of draping also got nods. But seeing the latest iterations of that horn dress, it was impossible not to cast back to the golden coif Alexander McQueen put on Naomi for his fall 1997 couture collection for Givenchy. Or how, at the same house, Tisci once toyed with horns on baseball caps and the like. Here, such excrescences appeared stylized as cone breast numbers or amped-up shoulder constructions and as makeup stunts, notably on Georgia Palmer with a faux pregnant belly (just to take it utterly over the top, the wails of an infant were piped in for that moment).The main event, design-wise, was squarely north of the belt line, as below most looks skewed more latter-day Pigalle: Next to these lace numbers, McQueen’s bumster moment felt prim in retrospect. The Spanish influence continued in matador hats refashioned from Nike baseball caps, and a neat matador jacket embellished with hand-knit rosettes made by arte sacro artisans in Seville. The embroidery on a corset and a hand-shredded tulle shrug also owed a debt to Cristóbal’s archives. The materials, however, were strictly 21st century, and included sustainable fabrics from Ecco Leather, Beglarian Fabrics, and Eyand.', 'Luisa Beccaria’s presentation was a family affair, held en plein air at Milan’s Villa Reale, a fitting venue for such a personal showcase. LùBar—the charming café in the palazzo’s outdoor courtyard—was launched and managed by Ludovico Bonaccorsi, one of Luisa’s five children. Aptly titled Togetherness, the collection highlighted the significance of familial bonds and the joy of shared celebrations, as noted by Lucilla Bonaccorsi, who collaborates creatively on the collection alongside her mother. Models strolled among the guests, who indulged in sweets and cappuccinos in a relaxed atmosphere.The collection stayed true to Beccaria’s familiar repertoire of romantic, delicate dresses. Adding a touch of variety to the largely occasion-focused lineup were a series of charming earth-tone cotton Vichy sundresses with long circle skirts and heart-shaped bodices, alongside playful beachside ensembles, featuring linen shorts with crochet embroidery paired with frilly bralettes and breezy chemises printed with dainty florals.For more dressy occasions, the Beccarias delivered the belle-of-the-ball looks they’re known for. Ethereal gowns in soft pink and cerulean organza were complemented by shimmering sequins, lace and laminated fabrics, rendered into enchanting dresses. If you’ve ever imagined becoming a fairy-tale princess, the Beccarias seem to have the magic to turn that fantasy into reality—if only for the time of a ball.', 'Lutz Huelle’s spring show took place at the INHA, the library of the Institut National de l’Histoire de l’Art—a venue worthy of winning the award for The Most Stunning Location of Paris Fashion Week. Huelle also deserves recognition for presenting one of the most delightfully clever and inventive collections of the week, proving that, despite a limited budget, with good ideas, a skillful handling of the métier and a sense of humor, you can deliver a knockout show.The wood-paneled library of the INHA is housed in the grand Salle Labrouste, a 19th-century marvel. To grasp its magnitude, it holds 1,800 manuscripts, 20,000 rare books, 30,000 prints, and 45,000 autographs. “When you consider that books have been burned or banned in some parts of the world, the fact that this place was built to safeguard and share knowledge is truly amazing,” Huelle remarked. Its frescoed high ceilings are topped by domes “round and ample like crinolines,” that apparently inspired the architecture. “There’s an echo of fashion here,” Huelle noted. “Everything we create builds on what came before us. If you consider how much progress is represented in this space—and fashion is progress, always evolving, always at the forefront of who we are.”Huelle’s inspiration for the collection sparked when he spotted a couple on the street, dressed in formal wear—the man in a sharp suit, the woman in a flowing evening gown. This encounter made him contemplate the gap between these two wardrobe archetypes, and explore how he could gradually transform a traditional blazer-and-trousers ensemble into a dress suitable for special occasions.To do so, he played a sort of cut-and-paste charade, where he started slicing off a suit at the waist, using the bottom part as a skirt. From there he went inventive, reworking and assembling wardrobe staples and trimmings—a crisp tuxedo shirt (accordion-pleated at the waist and made into a bustier), an oversized bomber (the front was cut out and lined with lace exposing its layers), and lengths of lace ribbons (left dangling from a cotton T-shirt,  attached on the waist of a blazer, or trailing behind a satin dress). One of the standout pieces was a silver and black jacquard evening bustier top stitched to a men’s white poplin shirt—it practically begged to be part of your wardrobe. Equally attractive was a voluminous duchesse opera coat, featuring horizontally-pleated pagoda sleeves, replicating the vertically-pleated bib of a tuxedo shirt.Huelle wears his remarkable creativity and skills with such levity, it feels almost ridiculously effortless—you could imagine him cleverly crafting an entire collection from a simple white T-shirt in no time, and with no pretense.', '“I think fashion shows are overrated,” said Margherita Maccapani Missoni: “I’ve been going to them since I was two-weeks-old, so they are not my goal with Maccapani. Instead to present this collection I want people to enjoy a moment, to feel the storytelling and vibe.” She said this from a bamboo chair in the garden of Via Caltanissetta 3—the beautiful Art Deco former home of the Olimpia Milano basketball team—while a friend in a knit bodysuit cut figs on a moss-bedded floral display nearby.She continued: “The idea here is that this house is lived in by a group of girlfriends. They’re tired of social expectations and constraints so they’ve moved in together to be a cultural hub. These are not teenagers: These are women who’ve decided to get together and get on with their lives.” As if on cue a young women in a rib-knit cardigan (new category alert) and droopy-flower printed vest top with artificial boning (counterfeit corsetry) appeared on a balcony above and gave us a wave. The rooms upstairs contained various Maccapani mise-en-scènes; in the bathroom a woman in fishnets washed a floral catsuit in the basin; next door a DJ in a fringed wrap mini and bias crop T-shirt fine-tuned an upcoming set, and along the way two friends—one in a stretchy floral print dress, the other in a bodysuit, opera gloves, and a hoodie/snood/wrap—did a jigsaw puzzle.The grown up grunge Maccapani is tilting toward is taking shape. Another development today was the announcement of a new partnership with eBay that will give Maccapani a permanent shop front—all Buy It Now, no auctions—that will see both garments and Missoni-curated vintage accessories sold on the platform. Today’s collection was styled against accessories—dubbed MaccaFinds—that the designer had previously sourced on eBay. These included a vintage Missoni shoulder bag, Murano glass necklaces, a Roberto Cavalli belt, and some rhinestone heels by Rene Caovilla. This was an interesting new experiment in shaping a DTC platform for this young but well-supported concern.', 'Skepta’s mid-2000s emergence as a leading voice in the UK grime scene helped hasten the sunset of the scene that came before: UK garage. Ironically, though, it was his mixed fortunes getting into the late-’90s/early-aughts, super-dressed-up garage nights in venues like Aquarium, Bagleys, Camden Palace, and the Colosseum that, in part, inspired him to focus on the form that eclipsed it—and to thus shift the needle of London’s nightlife fashion.As he said during a preview for this second show in his Mains reset: “I do take some of the blame. I used to walk up to clubs when we were doing Tracksuit Mafia, and they were like, ‘You can’t come in wearing that.’ Then someone would say, ‘This is Skepta,’ and they would let me in with the tracksuit. That’s was that whole ‘That’s Not Me’ shit was about. It was saying, ‘I’m going to break the mold because you’re not seeing us. I’m going to make it in a tracksuit.’ But now I want to bring back getting dressed up.”The preshow set list featured old-school legends Oxide and Neutrino, Artful Dodger, and the mighty MJ Cole. The printed denim yearbook sets were an irresistible Mains take on the Moschino equivalents that almost assured you entry into the hype-iest garage nights back when, prestardom, Skepta was working retail at TK Maxx (the UK version of TJ Maxx) and plotting his look for the weekend. Working with Moschino now, he added, is something he would very much like to explore. The Mains printed jeans were delivered in the “garage cut” that was originally refined through alteration to allow the wearer to best display their loafers from Patrick Cox or Gucci. This collection’s equivalent to those original pieces of trophy footwear was a sprawling collab collection with Kickers that included a satisfying sample of Alessandro Michele’s Gucci 1.0-era kangaroo-lined snaffle slide.The clothes and show approached nostalgia from multiple angles. The collection was titled Non School Uniform and revisited some of the tailoring (ties included) and varsity tropes of institutional education from both sides of the Atlantic. The opening and finale played out to Tim Minchin’s “When I Grow Up” from the Matilda musical: At the close, Skepta’s daughter, River, ran happily through the crowd alongside her dad and a bunch of friends. Wearable freshness included the hilarious faux wig/headpieces cooked up by Skepta and his head of design, Mikey Pearce. We were the first to hear a strong new Ye x Skepta track that sounded like it sampled Pink Floyd.Said Skepta: “We’re doing one show a year [with Mains], so there’s not so much pressure. I feel like we established a lot of the language at the first show, so now we’re having fun with the silhouette and developing that language.” Distinctly British, specifically autobiographical, but also highly translatable beyond these shores, Mains feels like a project with potential and momentum.', \"A best-seller is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it brings in some good ol’ cash flow and helps build a label’s cultural cache, but on the other, it can cause fatigue. Maisie Schloss has had somewhat of a hit on her hands with her perforated knits for her Maisie Wilen label, but their popularity also had the designer in limbo between exploring new things and delivering to her customers. “I started to feel a little angsty towards them the last couple of seasons because they have been so popular,” said Schloss, calling from her apartment in California. “They were inhibiting me from showing new things because people were focused on them, while I’m like, ‘Hey, look at this other stuff I made!’ but this season I’ve fallen in love with the fabric all over again.”This rekindling was provoked by Schloss switching up her design methodology this season. This is a designer known for her URL-heavy design vernacular, with digital prints and optical illusions often taking the spotlight in collections. “Previously, I’ve been almost entirely digital,” said Schloss, explaining that everything from her sketching to her silhouette development was mostly done digitally. “Once it was all finalized on the computer I’d make the actual things, it was all very calculated,” she continued. There is a practicality to working that way, but Schloss is right to underscore how this approach often leads to a more neatly packed result, which is efficient but not always the most exciting.Instead, this season Schloss closed her laptop and ventured into the streets of Los Angeles to scour for deadstock materials, exchanging her meticulously pre-planned lineups for a more improvised and material-led design approach. She wrapped the body in raffia and threaded vintage beads together to create funky separates that hung away from the body like bejeweled fishing nets, and took her existing fabrics—such as that famous perforated jersey—and gave them a sense of novelty with winding and twisting draping.“It feels like fine art, observing an image and creating it simultaneously,” said Schloss of her new methodology, which gave her collection a sense of dimension. “I was like, 'I have to log off for a minute,’” the designer joked. Good thing she did.\", '“The body has to breathe,” said Rabih Kayrouz—and he meant it. The breathtaking opening look of his collection, a suit in a clear shade of red made using a crispy paper-like cotton, featured a near-weightless jacket constructed of just three pattern pieces. “It’s completely free on the side, and on the shoulder there is a ribbon that holds the pieces together,” the designer explained on a call. His drawings reveal that many of the items were magicked up from rectangular cuts of cloth. Patterns and form, rather than themes and decoration, make this designer tick. “I’m a couturier. I’m not an art director,” said Kayrouz. “I am here to work a collection; to create cuts and to create volumes.”Along with breezy tailoring, the designer offered flou in the form of liquid satin pajama-style pants, and volume in bubble-hemmed dresses that were more buoyant (in shape and attitude) than the horizontal, classical chic of a one-shoulder draped dress (which also came as a top) in royal purple. What Kayrouz referred to as his metallic jacquard “mermaid” dresses were fanciful in fabric only; the simple-seeming construction of Look 30, for example, was arrived at through exactitude.Adapted from a previous couture collection was a knit dress with spiraling cording; it was impressive but felt more consciously considered, stiffer, and formal in comparison with pieces like the elegant slip-on-and-go shirtdresses, generously cut khakis, and a strapless dress in a shade of orange that is guaranteed to brighten your mood. “We must create joy ourselves,” said Kayrouz. “I mean, we can look at the world, especially nowadays, especially in my country, things are not fine. To do my work and to do it rightly, to do it correctly and honestly, this is what brings me joy; it’s kind of a refuge.”', \"Japanese culture serves as constant inspiration for Maiko Kurogouchi. With each new season, she draws from this rich heritage, showcasing her references through meticulously curated moodboards and displays of beautiful artefacts or books. Her work reflects a deep connection to traditional Japanese aesthetics, which she weaves into her modern designs.Although she is typically drawn to revitalizing traditional crafts with an emphasis on textures, surfaces, and materials, this season she shifted her focus to Katachi—the form and shape of objects. This marked a subtle departure from her usual approach, leaning more into conceptual exploration, while still honoring the craftsmanship at the heart of her work.While designing her spring collection, working with pottery led her to contemplate the nature of form—how it is both tangible and elusive. She became captivated by the simplicity of found or familiar objects, such as stones discovered on a walk through the hills, ceramic buttons crafted by artist Lucie Rie, seashells, and ceremonial lanterns. She began capturing them in close-up photographs, then sketched them by blacking out the details, leaving only the abstract contours of their forms. These simplified silhouettes became the foundation for the slender, serene designs in her collection, showcased at Ogata, a Japanese haute-cuisine restaurant.Kurogouchi played on lithe shapes, crafting garments that were delicately pleated, asymmetrically draped, or softly shaped into cocoon-like forms and off-the-shoulder flowing tunics. They were presented in a neat palette of black and white, accented by occasional flashes of luminous green. A standout piece was a form-fitting bodice in jade green, finely pleated in jacquard, featuring light voluminous sleeves and adorned with delicate sakura blossoms, inspired by the traditional lanterns of Kyoto.Despite its technical intricacy and layers of complex references to Japanese imagery and craftsmanship, the collection radiated a sense of poise, reflecting Kurogouchi's highly sophisticated and artistic approach to design.\", 'Georgina Chapman found inspiration far from home for her spring 2025 collection, looking to the Nemichi Shrine in Seki, Japan. The designer didn’t borrow aesthetics from the structure itself, but rather from the adjacent koi pond. Marchesa’s offering is an ode to water, with metallic fabrics mimicking light refracting off the water, wave-like lace appliqués, and fishtail silhouettes aplenty. Not everything was quite so aquatic, though: petal motifs dotted the collection like water lilies sitting atop the pond.Even Chapman’s more subdued designs—like a black ruffled off-the-shoulder cocktail dress, or a pink strapless number—feature dramatic flourishes. “[They are] more for our classic customer who’s looking for something that’s not too obvious but wants to have some drama,” she said.One dress, festooned with freshwater pearls, rhinestones, and delicate chains, looked as though it was rescued from a shipwreck. “[This] is our Marchesa quintessential beaded dress,” Chapman said of a blue gown with a plunging illusion V-neck, removable tulle cape, and a trail of rhinestones carving out an hourglass silhouette. Given that Chapman herself wore it to the Venice Film Festival premiere of The Brutalist, it’s safe to say she is the quintessential Marchesa woman.', 'Marco Rambaldi chose to showcase his spring 2025 collection in a Milan square, close to Castello Sforzesco. He was attracted to the meaning behind “the square” both as a meeting place and as a place to express opinions and be heard. His choice of venue was also related to those hidden memories that often resurface during the stillness of summer, revealing our true essence. Thus this special location, between Roman baths and a medieval tower, became the metaphorical place to share these memories. Rambaldi expressed this idea (which also recalled that weird feeling best known by those who come from the provinces) through his inclusive cast—a signature of his brand.A life made of simple things was translated into multicolored prints of an after-lunch table for tulle tops and sleek dresses, used to introduce that touch of eros always present in Rambaldi’s vision—eros that subtlety returned with skirts made of vintage satin petticoats or the organza proposals embellished with Swarovski crystals or treated to look like denim. Knitwear had a central role, not only in the heart-shaped jacquard—maybe Rambaldi’s most recognizable trait—but also in spongy new entries that recalled vintage advertising posters, reworked to become the “Circolo Rambaldi” merch.The use of crochet, another core element of Rambaldi’s aesthetic, was present as an insert in the pastel-tinged leather chosen for bombers and pencil skirts, or encrusted with crystals to add glamor to upcycled materials. The web of traditional crochet intarsia was also reproduced via laser on “real” denim pieces—real because in past seasons it was knitwear treated to look like denim—of contemporary outwear.', 'That’s the thing with the Paris show schedule: From designer to designer, show to show, a mood shift is positively guaranteed. That was certainly the case when going from the bravura maximalist theater of Alessandro Michele’s runway debut for Valentino to the cheery, welcoming calm of Margaret Howell’s showroom, where Howell and her design directors, Rosamund Ward (she oversees women) and Ioannis Cholidis (and he men), were on hand to talk through the collection.It was a very desirable, considered, and effortless mix of linen button-back dresses, belted raincoats, slouchy (to a degree) trousers, and layers of shirts (some cut to a new longer length), as well as unconstructed jackets with the ease of shirting, wide shorts, and sweaters that felt classic yet were imbued with a newness of fit, being that little bit looser and that little bit shorter. All of this came in a palette that felt traditional—browns, black, grays, a chalky white, and the softest greens—yet also reimagined to feel new, as if striving to find previously unimagined shades. (I loved that the pale blue-gray was, apparently, the result of a turnip-dyeing process.) All were worked across the likes of linen, Swiss cotton, denim, cotton drill, cashmere, and crisp wool.Yet despite the obvious aesthetic differences between Howell and the label that showed before her, something unites them: How you bring the past into the present, make it resonate, make it sing, make it feel alive. Howell is well versed in that. It’s a tribute to her intelligence and sensitivity as a designer that she can revisit elements of what she has done before because she can see how they connect to the everyday reality of how people dress in the here and now, often triggered by her noticing how people are dressing and putting themselves together.Howell’s aesthetic might sometimes reverberate with the past—her own or from some period of the 20th century (spring 2025, for instance, had some touches of the 1920s; the tunic-y patch-pocket shirt, say, or the collar on a sweater)—but the attitude and mindset are rigorously and undeniably of today. I’ve often thought she sees time as part of her creative process quite differently from other designers; plenty of the latter will tell you they want constancy while actually always wanting to relentlessly (and needlessly sometimes) move the hands on the clock forward, convincing you to discard everything that went before.', 'The first look at Maria McManus’s spring runway show, held at a gallery in Tribeca, was a classic khaki trench coat. Except, to further emphasize the extra attention to detail that she’s known for, it was shown inside out. The cotton lining with contrasting black seam binding seemed as purposeful as if the garment was made to be worn that way. After the show, when the designer stepped out in front of her tableau of models to speak about the collection as she is wont to do, she also described its styling as a way to inject new life into the things we already have in our closet. “We don’t always need to buy new stuff,” she said.The surprise this season quickly followed: a sleeveless black velour tunic with white crochet trim, worn with a long striped skirt. McManus doesn’t typically favor embellishment, and the look had a tactile quality that felt refreshing within her brand’s established DNA. It was inspired by an Irish linen tablecloth made by her Aunt Bibi that her mom had sent her after the last show. “It was all linen handkerchiefs embroidered together with macramé and crochet,” she recalled. “I’m not a super floral crochet person, but I was like ‘OK, this is meaningful.’”This handcraft feel continued with other full knitted macraméd looks, made by female artisans in Bolivia. An oversized square-shaped polo tunic and matching long skirt in a rich shade of burnt sienna had a louche feel in the way they bounced around the model’s body. Pieces in a silver viscose poly blend also added a tactile element, as if they were hammered metal. Little structured caps—some of them hand-embroidered—by Heather Huey completed the looks in a way that bridged the fantasy aspects of what a runway show can be with the down-to-earth elements that characterize the designer’s vision.Elsewhere, McManus’s classics were all present. A swingy long black knitted dress had a tighter weave at the bodice that created a trompe l’oeil effect, while a simple black button down shirt had a strong, structured shoulder that added a certain amount of gravitas to the black trousers—no belt—it was casually tucked into.', 'Marie Adam-Leenaerdt was a finalist for the 2024 LVMH Prize. Participating in this year’s competition brought a whole new audience to her show today. Though she didn’t win the award, she raised her own personal bar significantly here. Any show that starts with lunch is a good one, but Adam-Leenaerdt’s was especially so with her clever thoughts about clothes’ usefulness and functionality.We were gathered at Terminus Nord, a brasserie opposite the Gare du Nord popular with Belgians heading to and from Antwerp. There were oeufs mayonnaise, pâté en croute, and coffees on offer, and in the moments before the show began, the US critics at my table discussed the many rumored designer moves and all the houses hypothetically in play; it got very chatty. At more traditional shows, publications are typically separated from each other; the mixing at this one created a feeling of conviviality that producers could learn from. (This one was put together by Etienne Russo, a Belgian, like Adam-Leenaerdt.)The location was good for more than just gossiping. It fit with the message of the collection, which was sparked by the humble, everyday T-shirt—the uniform of the street. Backstage the designer, who is not yet 30, acknowledged the tee’s quotidian nature. “If everyone wears a T-shirt, that makes the wardrobe very flat,” she said. Her idea was to use comfy (her word) cotton jersey for more exceptional garments, like a drop-waist dress and a hooded trench. Either that or she was applying the T-shirt’s easy-on, easy-off nature to sweaters and dresses. What seemed to be belted rib knits with button-downs underneath were all one piece, while V-neck dresses only appeared to be layered over undershirts and lacy lingerie pieces—they were single garments too.These are not all-new ideas—the deconstructionists before Demna, with whom Adam-Leenaerdt worked at Balenciaga, were playing with similar notions a generation or two ago—but Adam-Leenaerdt’s clothes look cool and fresh, and that makes her proposals viable. Most novel were the blazers and coats for which she designed multiple interchangeable covers, “so you don’t dress the body, you just dress the garment,” she explained. The impact of an hourglass-cut lapel-less blazer was completely different in caution yellow nylon spandex than it was in a charcoal gray velvet jersey. Ditto a long strapless dress that she showed with both a matte nude cover, which yielded understated results, and a glossy tech-fabric version that looked more glam. It’s too soon to say if retailers will bite, but there’s a lot of utility built into this concept; it’s experimentation like this that keeps pushing fashion forward.', 'Marina Moscone was after “something softer” for spring. “Probably motherhood helps with that,” added the designer as her parents tended to her adorable infant son. Soft and light as a breath of air were sheer overdresses with charmingly scalloped lettuce edges, the result of their bias construction. These over sheaths were simple, chic, and sort of genius: Pop one on and you could instantly create a new look. In the lookbook, one of them was layered over a heavy satin dress (available in a luxe pearl gray or caviar) with sleeves that become a capelet at the back. Moscone applied her signature twisted looks to the straps on sleeveless frocks. Foulards inspired the side-tied double-sided polka dot column (red dots on navy lined with red dots) that looked as simple as a scarf wrapped on the body; of course the construction was more complicated than it appeared.Dots were also the basis of a new technique the designer engineered for fall. Starting with polka print laid flat, Moscone and team “joined four points together by embroidery to create a four-point flower; it’s our new version of smocking,” she said.  She applied this variously; in one case a sheer fabric was layered over the smocking and then a bead was added in the center of the flower; in another, a panel of the smocked fabric was suspended on a sheer dress body.Shine satins for evening gave way to more matte fabrics for day, but texture was still in play. The designer embraced imperfection with raw-edged cotton jacquard styles, asymmetrically applied pleats, and a perma-crinkle created through a bonding process. This last material was used for a pair of parachute pants that Moscone described as “soft utility.”  Soft or hard, women need clothes that work for them. Moscone’s preference for easy-to-wear column shapes makes getting dressed uncomplicated. As special and impressive as the smocked looks were, florals can lose their bloom. In contrast, the monochrome designs (and that double polka dot look) had a forever quality to them.', 'It’s no secret that Mark Fast is a raver. Where in the past he’d party hard in his native Canada, these days he’s constantly on the search for music in the sanctuary of his London studio. “I love that adrenaline rush of feeling a new song and feeling the bass,” he said at a preview. “For this show, I wanted to create a space that gives me nostalgic feelings of when I used to dance in front of the speakers in underground clubs.”The result of this instinctive sensory experience? Reworked takes on his signature silhouettes, made for the modern club-goer. “It’s still very much in the heart of the customer that they wear [the pieces] out,” he said. Fast’s fan base will be hitting dance floors in his recognizable knitwear, which arrived as body-flossing dresses and separates in neon green and pink, as well as red, yellow, orange, and blue. There were options for his celebrity loyals, too: the finale looks, two crocheted dresses with super-fine strips of tulle fringing on the skirts, could be alt red-carpet ensembles, and the mini purple-grey fringed version was fit for a festival stage.“What else would they wear in their worlds? And what would I wear, actually?” he said. “I love my drama, and I have it. But also, who is this woman? This woman likes to go out, she also likes to be warm.” And so he introduced layers for his revelers this season: windproof outerwear, denim jackets, shell tracksuits, and sweatshirts.For those on the benches who have watched Fast’s shows over the past decade or so, his intended feeling of nostalgia was stirred in the colorful, strip-lit room of East London’s Bike Shed—a venue he chose for its likeness to those clubs he went to. He’ll be dancing in his spring collection come 2025.', 'Designer Alexandra O’Neill’s nephew was born just a few weeks ago, and she had her ever-growing family of nieces and nephews on her mind for her spring 2025 collection. “I was thinking about how we grew up as kids and how we used to run around my grandparents’ backyard in Long Island wearing matching outfits,” she said. Her drawing board began by sourcing prints and patterns reminiscent of childhood, from dainty eyelet trims to preppy ginghams and even floral prints reminiscent of the wallpaper you would find in a little girl’s room.While there is a stereotype about adults who dress in matching looks, for O’Neill, you’re never too old to twin with your loved ones. Throughout her collection, she used identical prints and fabrications but switched up the detailing, so that while you’d look similar, you wouldn’t be wearing the same item. Butter yellow embroidered fabric was used to create two gowns—the Sonja and the Pyrra—with one featuring cutout detailing and the other without; an excellent option for any future bridesmaids.Markarian may be known for evening dresses, but new this season was more casual daywear. Ruche-detailed Italian cotton dresses and tanks accompanied some of the fancier pieces in the collection; perfect for those who may not be going to many events. “We’ve added a lot of daywear this season, which is not something we have focused on in the past,” said O’Neill. “It’s slightly more elevated than a plain cotton day dress, but these new pieces are made of great Italian cotton, with a little ruching and little floral details. You can wear them around the city, or if you throw heels on, they can even take you to a summer wedding.” And while one doesn’t necessarily associate denim with Markarian, as of this season, keep the label in mind. The designer successfully experimented with an embroidered denim eyelet with colorful sequined florals reminiscent of the fun jeans we wore in elementary school.', 'Francesco Risso is now in his ninth year at Marni, and it seems he’s only improving with time. Today’s collection was one of his finest yet: Though more restrained by his usual pyrotechnical standards, it still captured all the magic and enchantment Risso consistently conjures from his Mad Hatter ingenuity.The show was held at Marni’s headquarters, a vast and spare space suffused with dark red light. Crowds in hysterics screaming for celebrities were nowhere in sight. The seating arrangement, a sparse and labyrinthine layout of chairs seemingly scattered at random, surrounded three black grand pianos. On each seat lay a poem, printed on origami paper, by an unknown author. It was about a white rabbit darting through the quietude of a dark moonlit forest. But swoop! In a flash, the bunny vanishes. “Beauty is a white rabbit,” said Risso backstage. “You chase it, though you fall short in capturing it.” Perhaps this time he succeeded.Staying true to his whimsical radicalism, Risso crafted the entire collection solely from cotton, experimenting with its textures and weaves in various forms. Cotton, a perennial, honest material, symbolizes resilience and embodies the “purity of beauty” that Risso said he has been pursuing. “The cotton thread represents the thread that mends relationships and wounds, guiding us back to the right path after we’ve strayed and leading us toward what I call the essential beauty routine,” he explained. Fittingly, this was also the title of the show.The collection’s approach was “rather liturgical,” as Risso put it: He wanted to evoke the ritualistic nature of fashion shows from a bygone era, when the progression flowed seamlessly from daywear through les tenues d’après midi, culminating in grand evening gowns. Here, Risso began with slender silhouettes in soft hues, punctuated by dashes of black and white: fitted blazers over leggings, cropped chemises worn backward like capelets, and small hourglass dresses shaped by vertical pleats. Gradually, the designs transitioned into more voluminous forms, featuring broad-shoulder jackets and tuxedos paired with tight siren skirts with stiff ruched hems. They introduced a hint of ’50s couture further accentuated by wondrous hats “à la Audrey Hepburn.”Nostalgia doesn’t feature in Risso’s vocabulary, though; the stunning parade of evening gowns that closed the show was a masterclass in fresh, poised fabulousness. Bustier dresses with pannier skirts were printed with bold, blown-up roses or exquisitely fluttered with shredded cotton feathers embroidered with shimmering crystals. “They’re glimpses of impossible beauty,” said Risso. “Beauty is pervasive. It makes everyone feel more beautiful.”', 'When the iron gates of the 17th churchyard clang shut early and you’re begging the guardian to be let in… The slightly gothic experience of getting into Marques’ Almeida’s show turned out to be a serendipitous scene-setter for the clothes. Back in London for the first time since the pandemic, Marta Marques and Paolo Almeida returned with a fresh infusion of renaissance shapes and baroque floral brocades.The view from the pews of St Paul’s Church in the heart of Covent Garden was of doublet jackets, high-necked ruffled shirts, 17th-century milk-maid dresses and fabrics with a rich antiquey-feel. All of it was cleverly run through the filter of Marques’ Almeida’s recognizable signatures: denims, boyfriend jeans, and casual jackets, but now noticeably without the rips, frayed edges and hanging threads with which they first made their name as CSM MA graduates in 2010.On a zoom call from their home-base in Portugal, where the couple re-centered themselves when the pandemic hit, they explained that a trip to the Rijksmuseum had started it. “We were in Amsterdam for a weekend, without the kids for once,” Marques laughed. “And came back really inspired by 17th century Dutch portraiture.”It called for pearly eau de nil brocades, flowered tapestry and lace, inverted triangle bodices and cavalier sleeves to hybridize with belted jackets. As long-time experts in the art of denim, they came up with amazing new techniques: embossed baroque lily patterns and laser-printed scans of lace in pieces dyed in lovely shades of washed-out sky-blue.What’s the difference between how they feel now and when they left London? “Well, we’ve always had our relationships with customers who we’ve been inspired by—we used to call them M’A Girls. But we’ve grown up and they’ve grown up,” said Almeida. So now we say M’A People.”True: they’ve really polished it up since we last saw them in London. For one thing, the setting this time was far from the railway-sidings, derelict clubs, and East End warehouses where they used to convene shows. The historic setting of St Paul’s suggested a lot of associations: Nell Gwyn, the actress who sold oranges in Covent Garden market and became the King’s mistress, and the famous fictional Victorian Cockney Sparrow Eliza Doolittle, who sold flowers on the steps of the St Paul’s in My Fair Lady, for two.Something of their feisty spirit seemed to inhabit the attitudes of the models—a diverse cast of characters age-wise who were clearly enjoying their moment. That female gang-spirit, and the fits that Marques’ Almeida customers have loved and collected were all present as ever, but in a different context. These days, Marques’ Almeida people’s criteria for cool might not be stuff that works in a club, but to cover more overground occasions like dinners, weddings, and whatnot.This collection—with this new streak of maturity and sophistication—upped the Marques’ Almeida game. They’re not planning to return from Portugal any time soon, but the couple say that their spiritual fashion home will always be London.', 'It’s been a benchmark year for Maryam Nassir Zadeh, what with a sell-out J.Crew collaboration and a pair-up with ba&sh, which together gave her particular brand of downtown cool some major exposure. These “extracircirculars” were anything but a distraction when it came to creating her namesake collection for spring, however: “I felt more clear about what I wanted to make,” she said on a walk-through. Zadeh was just as sure about the material she wanted to use—it’s a silken spring at MNZ and a colorful one. The designer described her palette as being pulled from “ice cream” (or sorbet) hues like mango, citron, guava, pistachio, and cherry, which she balanced with brown tones, in a sort of equivalent to a milk-chocolate ice cream dip.Moodier hues were mainly used for seriously sexy bikinis, unisex looks in plaid (an unexpected trend this season), and denim. But the real draw of the collection draw were the light and bright pieces which were layered and combined in interesting ways in the lookbook by the stylist Camille Bidault-Waddington. Among the day-to-day options are the label’s best-selling dance pants, this season with a long swatch of fabric fringe hanging from one hip (a detail that also appears on a skirt). Shirting options that look femme rather than “borrowed from the boys” were inspired by vintage favorites. A leather bomber in a shade of iridescent pink you might find in a bottle of decorative “pearls” in the baking aisle was paired with a sheer chiffon wrap skirt with a generous slit. “I still have an affinity for transparency,” noted the designer, who made shrunken blouses, with a slightly ’40s air in the same material. She used habotai for weightless bra tops that you’ll want to shop like pick-and-mix candy.A side-laced ruffled cotton skirt has a substantiality that Zadeh carried over from her J.Crew collection. “Sometimes I feel when we make MNZ garments, they’re a little bit ethereal; they don’t have that weight in the depth, but I feel like this has that,” she said while holding the skirt, which was made to be taken out on the dance floor. Also fun are the many slightly structured sheaths with a decorative bands of fabric under the bust and the floaty chiffons with inset godets in contrasting colors. One wafty number was “tamed” with an insert of a Japanese woven organza, while clear sequins on cotton were overprinted in blue-and-white, nodding to the pottery Zadeh collects. Many of these frocks sit on your body like a dusting of powder.They’re “just romantic and easy,” said Zadeh. “I feel like it’s very hard to find good dresses these days, [and] sometimes if you want to dress, you just want to feel like it’s just chill”—in terms of both aesthetics and price tag. It’s no secret that the prices of designer clothes are skyrocketing, or that as they do, perspectives on value are shifting along with them. Of working with J.Crew, she said, it was “so awesome to make something that will last for a long time that’s [also] inexpensive. I mean, if you can snatch it and hold onto it and you cherish [a piece of clothing], I feel like that could be luxury.” Maybe it’s not only beauty, but luxury too, that’s in the eye of the beholder.', '“It feels much more sophisticated,” said Masha Popova of the spring collection she presented this afternoon. The reason for this sudden shift in mood? “I’m already 33! It’s time to act like an adult.” The designer is hardly ancient, especially in a business where creative directors lead successful careers well into their 80s. But a healthy dose of existentialism this season saw Popova abandon the bubblegum angst of her previous collections for more of a take-charge attitude. And so her models strode through the much-improved NewGen space at 180 The Strand in grandma-ish glasses, tweed jackets, and grown-up pussy-bow blouses. “The girls are now ladies,” said Popova.But even the most together of adults sometimes feel like teenage interlopers. A 33-year-old might purchase a pencil skirt because it seems the age-appropriate thing to do, but there will come an afternoon when she realizes the zip has been left undone since the morning. Or that her bra straps were on show during an important meeting. Or that she has perhaps been walking around the office with her dress caught in her knickers without anyone having mentioned it. Popova explored these everyday vignettes in jersey dresses with too-long straps falling around the elbows, tailored jackets with integrated capes, and half-zipped miniskirts sewn onto longer mid-length versions. “It’s all about impulsive dressing,” she said, taking inspiration from photographer Patrick Magaud’s 1984 book, Exhibition in Paris, which captured a model in various states of tongue-in-cheek deshabille. “I find it beautiful when things get stuck or don’t quite fit. It tells the story of a person’s day,” said Popova. She could have cheated these effects with styling but instead demonstrated her construction skills.The designer said she enjoys working with denim for a similar reason—for how the worn experience reveals itself in fades and stretches. And having already proven what she can do with a pair of jeans—see those signature hip-flashing boot-cuts—Popova wanted to trick the eye into seeing them just about everywhere else. Waterproof trench coats had been put through several treatments to evoke aged denim; the surfaces of tailored trousers were scraped to reveal the grain within their underlayers; and tweed jackets had been spun from indigo cotton. Even the Adidas Superstars worn by this morning’s models—a one-off customization project with the sports giant—had been coated in different layers of bluish colors and pierced with antique brass studs. They’re not for sale, but they should be.', \"Ian Griffiths got thinking about the cultural marginalization of science in favor of the arts after reading—and, okay, watching—Lessons in Chemistry. Backstage he pondered: “Why do people dismiss science and math so much when there is such a strong parallel between what a scientist does and what we in design do: imposing order on chaos? What’s the difference between E equals MC squared and a Marcel Breuer armchair? In some ways there is no difference.”And with that eureka moment this excellent designer—whose employment at Max Mara since 1987 is something many houses stuck on the creative director carousel must envy—got cooking. Griffiths’s process tends to take in a female protagonist, and this time he struck upon Hypatia, the overlooked (of course) Alexandrian polymath. “People complained that there's not enough time to experiment anymore,” said Griffiths, relishing his words. “But I don't think this is true: we took a completely new approach to developing this collection.”That approach was to take the parabolas of Hypatia and the geometry of Pythagoras, and then develop a formula of design that enabled their addition to Max Mara. The results were multiple and marvelous. A few examples included the brown knit dress, one-shouldered, whose ribs arced in a strict but languid parabola across the body, framing a circular cut-out at the waist. A later gray knit companion piece included two shallow oval cut-outs above the hip bone: as their wearer moved these blinked as if delivering a message in code.Darting was promoted from behind-the-scenes to center stage: these angled planes worked to define the silhouette of the garments and echo the geometry of the women within them. On a gabardine work jacket the storm flap was buttoned back on the collar to form a perfect equilateral ornament. A nice contrast to these precision pieces were the pants and jackets in silks as crumpled as the scrunched up papers in a physicist’s wastebasket.At first sight this was a typical Max Mara collection; there was camel, there was cashmere, there was tailoring. Every piece overlapped via a median of exceptional neutrality, outstanding garments that never strived to stand out. But Griffiths’s empirical conceit was a plus.\", 'On Friday, the American Church in Paris was the backdrop for a renaissance of sorts.Following some last-minute drama courtesy of the Frankfurt airport customs authorities, Maxhosa Africa made it to PFW with a spring lineup that transposed history, symbolism, and craft techniques like beading into light, modern silhouettes.Backstage before the show, creative director Laduma Ngxokolo said he was inspired by traditional artifacts and motifs from his native Xhosa culture, which produces some of the most magnificent beadwork on the continent. But he also cast farther afield to incorporate elements from an array of African cultures.Borrowing, transforming, and reinterpreting those archetypes is a delicate practice, the designer allowed. “We are trying to approach it in a way so that the result is not obvious,” he said. “If you know, you know. And if not, that’s okay too. We want people to wear these clothes on a daily basis and not just associate them with traditional ceremonies.”Fashion, he noted, offers a means of rewriting history in the correct way. “We have a responsibility as Africans to define our future and not let others come in and do it for us” he said. Hence, resurrection.Having turned the altar into a stage, Ngxokolo sent out a tableau of the house’s signature knitwear. Cardigans might suit corporate settings as much as the beach, while a Venus-on-the-half-shell halter top, with tiers of iridescent fish scales and a swingy pearl fringe, was a party all on its own. Colorful polos and shirts—including one that riffed on both African symbols and the Sistine Chapel—mixed with statement graphic dresses. A long black and white number with a raffia belt and a short one in shades of blue and green looked strong. The brand’s approach—local sourcing, semi-naturals for summer, merino and mohair for winter—makes it possible to achieve zero waste: Leftovers are repurposed into pieces like the colorful patchwork coat shown here. The ethos, Ngxokolo said, is “retro-aspirational”— retro for Africa; aspirational overall. Thanks to a celebrity clientele that includes Michelle Obama, Alicia Keys, and Sarah Jakes Roberts, Maxhosa Africa made the leap to New York last spring, opening a flagship on lower Broadway.Utopian as it may sound, Ngxokolo sees the continent following in the footsteps of Asia, becoming high tech and ahead of the curve on a number of points. “In 10 years, I see African fashion competing head-to-head with European, American, and Asian fashion,” he said, citing among other reasons a fast-growing tech scene and an emergent middle class. “Those people need infrastructure, they’ll need resorts, and they’ll also want luxury.”', '“Just do it,” Nike’s famously rousing slogan, can be applied to any number of situations—but not to building a fashion brand. That’s a slow-and-steady proposition, as a mapping of 2023 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund winner Melitta Baumeister’s career demonstrates. In 2014, a year after graduating from Parsons, the designer launched her brand at New York Fashion Week courtesy of V-Files; a decade later, for spring 2025 she made her runway debut in Manhattan. She chose sports as her theme, and one way of reading this show was as a metaphor for the designer’s trajectory.There was no attempt to hide the work that goes into physical performance: The thump, thump of a working heart resounded in the elevators that took guests up to the show space, which was filled with the sound of the breathy panting of an athlete exerting themself.The show got off to a sprinting start, literally, thanks to Scout Bassett, gold medal track and field Paralympian, who modeled the first look. Baumeister explained that it wasn’t The Games that set her creative process rolling, but her interest in movement and acceleration. Up until now, she has presented her work in a lookbook format, with photography that emphasizes the sculptural shapes she’s known for. The missing piece was motion. The models’ walk made the plissé dresses come alive; their bounce was somewhere between that of a balloon and a slinky.(American) football shoulders have long been an inspiration, whether replicated or interpreted (see Claude Montana) in fashion. Baumeister interpreted them as round, arching spans or sharp peaks; both fit right into her taxonomy of shapes. Creating a sense of aerodynamics were dramatic and gravity-defying coiffures, flying braids or triangles of windswept, and set, hair. Supersizing V-necked football jerseys and rendering them in padded fabric created an interesting sense of flatness. Tank-shapes, used for dresses and separates, looked especially sleek. One suspects Baumeister’s partner, a dedicated cyclist, inspired the bike shorts. The designer also zips around on two wheels, though usually in a black dress and cap.Sweats with unusual cuts have long been part of MB collections: this season they were sprayed by hand to create a worn-in look, as if taking a cue from the brand’s popular denims, which are silk-screened after they have been produced. It was difficult to relate some of the looks, such as the last exit, an attractive take on a biker/punk aesthetic, and a pointed column (look 34) which was difficult to walk in, and related back to the theme.  A varsity number sort of justified the silver bell that glimmered down the catwalk. “I do feel like we have a lot of humor in our collections,” Baumeister said in her stoic way. This outing once again demonstrated that her talent is nothing to laugh at.', 'Congratulations are in order: Meryll Rogge married her partner this past May in Cadaqués, the same small Catalonian fishing village where Salvador Dalí once lived (his house has been preserved as a museum), and where the designer’s family has a home. This joyous occasion inspired a very personal collection. “Usually you are like, ‘Okay, what are we going to do this season?’ And you have a moodboard and you come across all these references. But this season was the opposite for me,” Rogge explained. “It literally started from: ‘What do I want to wear? What do I want to put on?’ It was a very intuitive way of designing and very freeing in a way…to have this moment of guilty pleasure [where] I can design whatever I want because I have nobody watching me or no frame of reference.”What does a fashion designer wear to her own wedding? Rogge figured there were three choices: Go with something vintage, ask a colleague to make something, or do it herself. Not surprisingly, she settled on the last option and went all in, creating four distinct dresses for herself. All of them made it into the collection and became the starting point for the rest of the offering. The most casual of the quartet (look 4) was a patchwork denim jacket and full skirt made, the designer said, of “upcycled Levi’s 501s—like the 1980s kind that doesn’t stretch and that really survived through time,” which referenced a 1969 wedding dress made by Yves Saint Laurent for Gersende de Sabran-Pontevès, duchess of Orléans, in shades of white. Retaining the palette and the piecing idea, Rogge chose a humbler and more substantial material. This idea was further developed into more casual pieces in blue denim, such as a fitted corset top, an overskirt, and removable collars on a country-gentleman-style check coat with outsize proportions.Next up was a kicky little ’60s-ish number (look 2), sheer white with same-fabric squares attached by big grommets fluttering over its surface. More mindful, more demure was a long, ivory-raw-hemmed sheath (look 16) made of the crinkled satin that is a brand signature. The pièce de résistance (look 20) was inspired by another Spaniard who lived in a fishing village, the couturier’s couturier, Cristóbal Balenciaga. In this case the references were general rather than specific. “I was just tapping the general codes and use of gatherings and drapes that lingered in my mind from Balenciaga,” Rogge explained. “It was more a subtle homage to Spain in all its facets too; the clean vast volumes like the white houses, thick walls, the simplicity—there are not too many frills or lace, only the enlarged broderie anglaise as decoration—and of course the total indulgence of creating at the same time a big fat wedding cake of a dress!”', 'Like a good playlist, Mfpen’s latest collection evokes emotions that exist almost outside of time. Though there are hesitant dabs of light blue and pale yellow, the clothes are mostly rendered in a palette of moody grays and blacks that hardly scream “spring.” Ditto for materials like pinstripe (these are tropical weight). Because Mfpen uses only deadstock fabric, textile and color choice are somewhat limited, but this is also a choice on the part of designer Sigurd Bank. Look more closely and you’ll see that a rib-hugging rocker-meets-grandad cardigan is made of a mesh knit; you’ll spy a sliver of midriff above a pair of flat-front slim legged women’s trousers, and notice a cheerful white floral fabric used for shirting. There’s also a necklace that, when closed in front, reveals two sides of a heart broken down the middle.This collection is not a meditation on melancholy; rather Bank, with blue eyes sparkling, explained that he put aside hardcore music for a moment to listen to the late-’90s post-punk he first heard as a teenager in Jutland (in the North of Denmark) in the early aughts. The designer’s been drawn to the underlying gentleness in the music, which put him in a mood “reminiscent of teenage romance and just also how teenage romance always brings teenage heartbreak in a way.” Love is somewhat interchangeable with youth here, as Bank was focused on the in-betweenness that defines the threshold of maturity. “There’s this tension between youth and adulthood, and in the same way, of rebelliousness and formality,” is how he put it.Bank was after that feeling of awkwardness and dressing up that comes with wearing something that’s not yours—like your dad’s suit for a date. Is it a costume or a trial run? Do the garments hide the self or reveal it? One member of the team told Bank that as a teen she would leave the house in a parent-friendly outfit that she’d peel off to reveal something more daring. “I know that’s probably very common, but wow.”That story impacted the way the collection is styled; note the shirt worn as a skirt. That idea of concealment and perhaps coded communication feels very Mfpen. The label’s brand of cool is difficult to describe. Nothing shouts. It might look well worn, and in fact could be made of vintage fabric, but it isn’t old, though once you learn that Bank’s grandfather owned a haberdashery, you can see that in the clothes, which deconstruct the lexicon of men’s tailoring and corporate attire. The double-breasted jacket is a bit cropped and worn with jeans; pinstripes are accessorized with a silver chain and a tie is tucked under a sweater from which shirttails flap. The effect is DIY without actually being homemade; it’s the spirit of making use of what you have and being okay with not being able to control everything. As in love, so in fashion. Bank’s comfort with a certain amount of chaos is what makes Mfpen so exciting.', 'He had me at The Talented Mr. Ripley.Though I was dubious that the Netflix series could live up to the 1999 film or Purple Noon before it, I was a quick convert when it streamed this summer. Michael Kors and his husband Lance LePere fell hard too. The mood board in Kors’s showroom was pinned with a photo of Dickie and Marge from the Ripley miniseries, along with black-and-white photos of Italian cliffs and sea.“It was still romantic, but darker,” Kors said of the series. “And did you know it was shot in color because Showtime, its original network, wouldn’t green light it in black-and-white? They converted it.” The noirish cinematography of the series, so different from its sun-drenched predecessors, is essential to its appeal, and it influenced Kors’s collection, as did its rougher-around-the edges sensibility.This wasn’t a dark collection—that’s not in Kors’s design vocabulary. His idea was to dig into the “rustic opulence,” he saw in elements of Ripley and on a recent trip to Ischia and Procida. Naturally, bathing suit dressing played a part. The show opened with a 1950s maillot, high-slit skirt, and a leather basket bag, and closed with an embellished broderie anglaise bandeau and long skirt.In between it back-and-forthed and blended city and country, high and low. Raffia trimmed everything from a ribbed knit tunic sweater to a lace dress, and embellished a “cocktail shaker” of a skirt worn with another maillot. Craft was very much in focus here, but it didn’t impinge on Kors’s trademark polish. On that front, he engineered shirts to stand away from the shoulders, and cut sequin and lace party dresses with portrait necklines. Marge covered, he turned his attention to Dickie, combing a navy top coat, black trousers, and brown turtleneck with white accessories. Did you clock the copies of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in those basket bags? “Print isn’t dead,” he said at our preview. I appreciated that too.', 'When things get really bad, at some point one has to convince oneself that they can’t get any worse. To that end, Mira Mikati is determined to keep looking on the bright side, come hell or high water. “If you think there’s no chance, then there isn’t,” she said during a preview. “I always believe that hope attracts hope and happiness attracts happiness. Otherwise, why get out of bed in the morning?”These days what gets Mikati going in the morning is her newfound green thumb. Learning how to garden has been on her bucket list for ages. Since she never does things by halves, she pulled on her boots and got her hands dirty out at a plant nursery in Kent. She was so thrilled with the process that she is now trying to grow her own basil, tomatoes, and flowers. Which is why her collection for spring was inspired not by a trip to some far-flung destination, as is her wont, but instead reflected what’s happening in her own backyard in London (“in the rain,” she quipped).Mikati’s sartorial garden was lush with radishes, artichokes, asparagus, carrots, mushrooms, corn, flowers, fruit, and tea (another of her obsessions). A top might be composed entirely of crocheted lemons; a sweater might sport a yuzu. Her clients have embraced her experiments in tailoring, the designer said, and this season she obliged with a suit embellished with beadings and bracelets right on the cuff or else in pinstripes reprising the colors of the rainbow. A denim jacket with produce peeking out from the breast pocket will likely be a hit, green thumb or not. For the evening, there was a mesh dress with colorful embroidery or a pajama-style top with rings of Swarovski crystals.This year Mikati marks a decade in the business, but her fans will have to wait another few months to see how that milestone translates into clothing, an artistic collaboration, or perhaps a new shop. “I want to celebrate in so many ways but have to make a choice,” she said. “You need to dream in one direction.”', 'Filippo Grazioli went crafty, artsy, and (why not?) a bit crazy for spring. He fully unleashed his inner eccentric on the runway, fearlessly and almost obsessively exploring Missoni’s zigzag pattern with an avant-garde verve that felt instinctive and urgent.Backstage before the show, he explained that he wanted to reenergize Missoni’s bold artistic spirit and the playfulness of its beginnings, which he believed had been left dormant and overlooked. He emphasized that the zigzag motif has deep ancestral cultural origins, which he aimed to honor through the collection with a primal, elemental rhythm. The designer delved into the archives and unearthed a vibrant striped collection with a totemic vibe, originally created in 1990 to celebrate the World Cup, that he reprised to further raise the chromatic spark.Ruth Asawa, an American artist known for her modernist looped-wire organic sculptures, served as the inspiration for Grazioli’s tour de force of revitalizing the zigzag motif. He translated it into a multitude of spiky 3D, triangular-shaped knitted forms that alternately undulated, protruded, or unfolded in accordion-pleated spirals or tremulous mille-feuilles on tubular tops, minidresses, and leggings, generating whirlwinds of kinetic energy. Other equally spectacular specimens included dresses made from knotted ribbons, tunics covered in round sequins as big as CDs, and clingy jacquard sheaths adorned with fringes haphazardly placed like colorful brushstrokes. Kudos to Missoni’s know-how for pushing its knitwear expertise to such remarkable expressive limits.What made the collection both punchy and strangely captivating was Grazioli’s unwavering focus. Though it may have appeared excessive, it was crafted with such single-minded conviction that it radiated a sense of joyful, admirable defiance. It delivered electrifying mixed signals and jolts of energy that kept the audience far from indifferent or, worse, asleep. That’s already a rather impressive accomplishment.', '“We’re in the endcore now.” That was the essay that popped up on my phone when I tapped the QR code on the front page of a newspaper sitting on my seat at the Miu Miu show. After a month of collections, it took a lot to grab my attention, but Endcore did it. The essay is the work of Shumon Basar, the British author of the 2021 book The Extreme Self. It asks questions about individuality—and the digitally influenced lack thereof—not unlike the ones Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons were posing at the Prada show in Milan a couple of weeks ago.Endcore, Basar writes, is “a widespread feeling that things we once held onto as unchangeable, fundamental facts are now ending…. We feel like The End is approaching, like an asteroid is hurtling towards us; but it also strangely never seems to reach us. So we keep waiting. Endcore…is a verb, a predicament, a texture of the time we call the present. It’s an unnerving, queasy contemplation we have entered an ‘after’ era—but it’s not after one thing (like ‘modernity’), it’s after everything.”If you know anything about Miuccia Prada, you know that this kind of big thinking is a turn-on for her. And there was some big thinking going on here. The newspaper, which was said to be “envisaged” by the artist Goshka Macuga, featured dozens of QR codes, each linking to different texts. Prada rejected the idea that there were direct links between the art project and the collection, but for the sake of this review, let’s establish the endcore lexicon.To start, there are underthings worn as outer things, such as white cotton slips; some had graphic sequined embroideries. Sporty track separates and cutout bathing suits are also in the mix, along with private-school uniforms 1970s-ish geometric prints lifted from a spring 2005 collection (when life and the Miu Miu label were simpler propositions). It was a real mishmash of things that don’t belong together yet somehow work together. Western belts and waitress dresses? Vintage-look slips and sporty bikini tops? Yes and yes. With its what-the-hell irreverence, endcore reflects our moment’s anything-goes attitudes. And was that Hilary Swank and Willem Dafoe on the runway? Also yes.', 'Having free access to the Margiela archive is like receiving manna from the fashion heavens; you need very little to breathe new life into an MM6 collection. For spring, the design collective enjoyed a deep dive into the inventory, meticulously exploring stacks of contact sheets belonging to Marina Faust—the official photographer for all of Martin Margiela’s shows—in search of inspiration.Their drive also came from a commitment to preserving the brand’s legacy and fashion pedigree for future generations. “We have no interest in sliding into the slippery slopes of becoming a streetwear brand or selling sneakers and skateboards just for marketing’s sake,” they stated. A touch of entitlement is understandable, given Margiela’s status as fashion with a capital F.Creating a summer collection, they admitted, poses challenges for the MM6 team. “We wanted to design something that speaks to us and stays authentic to our identity, but as a Parisian-Belgian brand with a gloomy mood summer, it isn’t the most familiar season to work on. Gucci can pull it off so well, but for us?”They revisited and reshuffled some of their repertoire’s best-ofs and history-making pieces from the archives, adapting them for the sweltering heat that now plagues our summers. They revived the DIY white dried-paint effect, which appeared on both men’s and women’s trousers and the ubiquitous cowboy boots, along with the humble supermarket shopping bag reimagined as a top. The well-known AIDS message T-shirt also made a return, designed to raise awareness; paired with shredded, tight-fitting jeans, it still managed to look relevant. Margiela’s signature concept of exposing a garment’s inner workings was also refreshed; here that included a paint stain on a top that hinted at the painting process and a protective flimsy foil layer, usually peeled off, left undone over a minidress.Set atop gold high heels for women and flip-flops for men and featuring oversized suiting, slouchy denim, short shorts, and sleeveless zippered vests and blousons, often styled on bare skin, the collection felt straightforward and well curated. It offered variety without any trace of nostalgia—something Margiela himself would likely consider absolutely anathema.', 'Good news for fans of Apple TV+’s Palm Royale series, which is set amidst the high society of Palm Beach: designer Monique Lhuillier’s entire spring assortment is inspired by the South Florida destination, known for its elevated beach style. “I’ve only been there a few times, but every time I’m there, I really understand the aesthetic,” said Lhuillier, who specializes in glitz and glamour. “I thought it would be a great starting point for this collection, because spring and summer is all about color, prints, and a joyous feeling.”The Palm Beach reference translated into both day and evening options. “There’s a lot more day elements in this collection,” she said. “It was about offering our customer versatility.” Striped button-ups with floral appliqués and dyed lace tops were paired with shorts for ease, and cashmere cardigans with gold buttons were layered bathing suits. Lhuillier also showed a hibiscus power suit for the ladies who lunch (a common species in PB), and ramped up her offering of linens too, including a pretty blush-pink floral dress with thin straps and a belted waist. “I want to dress my customers from lunchtime to evening,” she said. “People really dress up for nighttime.”Formal evening wear is her signature and unsurprisingly it was the highlight, though both her gowns and cocktail dresses had a more relaxed feel this season. “For me, Palm Beach exudes glamour, but with a sense of ease and sophistication,” she said. She showed a limoncello-print chiffon gown with a built-in back cape, designed to float out of a room, Some of her ball gowns with bolder 3-D floral embellishments would have been fitting for the 2024 Met Gala, in fact, with its “garden of time” dress code.Though the spring assortment was focused on easy-breezy silhouettes, Lhuillier wasn’t afraid to dial up the drama with shine—there were metallics aplenty. Her staple ombré column gown—in varying shades of pink, tangerine, and silver sequins—was like the fashion equivalent of a sunset.', 'Late last month, Michelle Obama wore a look from Monse’s most recent precollection to deliver a speech at the Democratic National Convention. That viral moment is likely the reason why designers Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia were in an American state of mind. It was evident even before the first look hit the runway; one only needed to notice the alternating red, white, and blue chairs. “This collection is an ode to America, because New York City is probably the only city that could have allowed us to open a company,” explained Kim during a preshow interview. The show opened with a khaki version of the same jacket Obama wore, but layered over a gathered and pleated white cotton shirtdress.In keeping with the America theme, football was also an inspiration. Models carried leather bags made to look exactly like, well, footballs, and there were also more collegiate classics like rugby striped polo shirts and a heathered gray hoodie. The latter was fused together with a khaki trench coat, with some parts appearing to be layered underneath the coat whole and others as if they were layered over it. It was one of the best pieces in the collection. It seems like only a matter of time before Taylor Swift is spotted carrying the football bag or wearing one of the poppy and preppy takes on sporty dressing.Contrasting those moments was a series of sequined separates and gowns. “Fernando loves shine; I’m a matte girl,” Kim explained. A beige long-sleeve polo-neck shirt embroidered with tiny sequins, worn with a matching baby blue skirt, seemed like the exact point where the two designers’ points of views met; a little bit fantasy but always grounded. The final dresses and separates were made from thick bands of fabric woven together to create refreshingly low-key evening looks.', 'Adrian Appiolaza, the new designer now in his third season at Moschino, is a fashion completist, intent on not just recasting the house founder Franco Moschino’s legacy for a 21st-century audience but also imparting all he knows about the tastemakers and the styles of decades past for anyone who’s watching. His show today was the runway equivalent of a subcultural grand tour, a study of fashion cliques from a guy with an obsessive eye for detail.\\xa0It started with a group of all-white looks: They were the connective tissue between this collection and his debut in February, and their draped silhouettes were inspired by a photo of Moschino twisting fabric around a mannequin that Appiolaza dug up. From there he made nods at other icons of his, inviting Terry Jones, the cofounder of i-D magazine, to produce graphic slogans in his trademark style for T-shirts and leggings and collaborating with the Judy Blame Trust to borrow some of the assemblage necklaces the iconic late designer was known to use as accessories.Blame’s edgy stylings seemed to have influenced the cocktail dress and Le Smoking embellished with punkish pearls, while the fedora-hat-wearing duo conjured his Buffalo era. The chalk drawings that decorated those hats, as well as the backs of the models’ coats (a shame you can’t see them in the runway images), reproduced one of Moschino’s childhood drawings. The stripey knits and lacy slip dresses evoked the famous grunge collection of Marc Jacobs—at least that’s what I saw—but the black-and-white polka dots, including some hand-painted directly onto models’ skin, were Franco Moschino through and through. Most ambitious and interesting were the deconstructed LBDs, little T-shirt tube dresses (tubinos in Italian, Appiolaza said) that from the back were cut in the more expressive shapes of the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s.\\xa0Will Appiolaza’s expansive vision conjure a Moschino clique? That’s the mission. “Fun and optimism are important for me,” he said. “I think that’s what people are going to find.” For the moment, at least, all those Easter eggs have aroused the attention of fashion obsessives like him.', 'Mossi Traoré dreams big. Somehow, despite being an indie designer and an outlier, he manages to make those dreams come true. Through persistence, talent, and charm, he has met his Bollywood idol and traveled the world sans expense account to fuse his notion of inclusive, ethical couture with craftsmanship from other cultures. Thirteen years ago, as he was ramping up his brand, he also founded Les Ateliers d’Alix—named for his fashion heroine, Madame Grès—to teach couture techniques to underprivileged youth living well beyond the périphérique. That social initiative now counts dozens of alums in the studios at Chanel, Dior, and elsewhere.This month, Traoré reached a couple of milestones. He took home the Grand Prix de la Création de la Ville de Paris, a major nod to his impact in fashion. And Chanel officially signed on as the main partner for Les Ateliers d’Alix, effectively taking over the administrative reins so that he can switch back into “Mossi mode.”“What I really wanted is to find a little more time to create, and especially to shine a light on couture that can be worn every day,” Traoré said backstage before his show.For spring, he revisited the classics in graceful, fluid jersey and structured Japanese denim and cool wool with color-blocking in black, white, and royal blue. Several pieces, including a couple of white blouses, a pleated black maxidress, a sleeveless white ensemble, and a black jumpsuit veiled in sheer white looked both on point and timeless. Intricate fabric treatments paid homage to the work of octogenarian French textile sculptor Simone Pheulpin to striking effect on a white dress that closed the show (the mauve handbags were also noteworthy). Plaid has been cropping up all over Paris this season; for the first time, Traoré gamely tackled that motif on some breezy-looking numbers in pink and blue check.In recent years, Traoré has been spotlighted at major shopping destinations like the Printemps flagship in Paris. With its renewed focus and a recently unveiled e-shop, the brand should finally be able to expand its reach.', 'Mowalola Ogunlesi has for the past two seasons disrupted the Fashion Week schedule with last-minute catwalks staged at industrial venues in far-out postcodes. The news that the designer would this time be inserting herself into an off-schedule closing slot was confirmed with less than 24 hours notice. Bold: the London after-parties would have to wait—and perhaps not happen at all considering the show ran more than 90 minutes late—but then again, who really cared? Not Ogunlesi, who is prone to provocation, nor the thousands of her fans in yeti boots and skin-tight mini dresses queuing around the block. It helped, too, that she put on the most stimulating show of the entire season.This was a mad and at times perverse spectacle quite unlike the twinkling elegance that has so far proliferated in the London collections. It was evident first from the choice of location—an air hangar-sized warehouse in north Greenwich dotted with go-go cages and simulacrum club bathrooms with one red platform splintering through the middle—and second from the make-up artist that could be spotted oiling the length of Ogunlesi’s arms in a backstage room heavy with cigarette smoke. Was the designer preparing to make an appearance on the catwalk herself? A coy shrug was as good as a “Yes.” And when the house lights did eventually dim, she spent the duration of the show performing 10 work-in-progress tracks from her upcoming album, titled Dirty Pop, in a platinum-blond wig as groups of models were intermittently dispatched into her seedy mise-en-scène.“I don’t wanna keep doing the same thing every season,” said Ogunlesi during a post-show conversation. “I’m on this Earth to do more than fashion and so I wanted this to be a full expression of everything I feel. Doing that with just clothes is not enough.” Said clothes were often imperceptible—such was the scale of the venue—but their attitude was obvious from the copious amount of skin that captured the light: ultra-cropped bikers, hirsute micro skirts, arm-binding tube tops cut from transparent latex, and sling-shot bodysuits with floor-scraping trains. (Even Ogunlesi’s shell jackets had been constructed with G-string crotches.) A score of deep-necked mini dresses, drop-shouldered bombers and toe-baring boots were made from cow hide, while LBDs, martial jackets, and enormous crescent bags were either printed or airbrushed to give the impression of pelt. “It’s all quite raw and animalistic,” said Ogunlesi. “It represents all the different skins I’ve had to climb in and out of while traveling from Nigeria to London, New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Korea…”', 'This season, Massimo Giorgetti opted for a presentation at MSGM’s headquarters, forgoing the traditional runway. Times of market volatility, global political turmoil, and economic uncertainty call for a more focused approach. Yet constraints can be a blessing in disguise, often sparking creativity. With his trademark optimism, Giorgetti was embracing the challenges head-on.For the designer, art and life naturally intertwine, as he frequently collaborates with artists and friends from the visual arts and the music industries. This season, his villa, La Vedetta—a former modernist observatory overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea—featured prominently on his mood board, serving as a backdrop for the collection’s images. Alongside photos of the house’s white and blue exteriors were images of Mario Bellini’s Figura chair, produced by Vitra in 1984, and the historic Klein-blue E-1027 residence, designed in the late 1920s by Irish designer Eileen Gray in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.MSGM collections have occasionally seemed overshadowed by an abundance of references, with numerous influences competing for attention. However, here the tightly curated selection allowed for greater clarity and focus. By paring down the variety of inspirations, the core vision somehow emerged more distinctly.The installation was curated by Fosbury Architecture, which crafted a labyrinthine pathway of Klein-blue sand, providing a vibrant contrast to the bold motifs and saturated colors of the collection. Among the standout pieces were a series of formfitting, feminine dresses in stretchy mesh, adorned with sequins and printed with softly faded florals or featuring spontaneous, haphazard ruffles; a handmade abstract drawing by painter Luca De Gaetano, which depicted vivid bouquets of Scotch brooms from La Vedetta’s garden, was translated onto an oversized chemise and pant set, as well as an hourglass-shaped minidress.Giorgetti said that the less-is-more approach seems particularly fitting in the current climate. “More care, more soul, and being generous with my energy.” That’s his guiding motto.', 'After the storm, the calm, and after the urban bustle, the bucolic retreat. Or so it has been for Mugler’s Casey Cadwallader, who has lately been spending time at his country home outside Paris, flexing those green fingers of his while digging the earth, cultivating the flowers, and tending his plants. Just don’t think that he’s giving himself and Mugler over to some idea of full-blown romance rooted in French jardins. Nope, not at all. This season everything was as darkly dramatic as ever. As Cadwallader took me through his moodboard a day or so before his show, he indicated a series of images showing cross sections of flowers that were almost anatomical, where the inner complexity of the blooms was laid bare. They looked rather disturbing in a sci-fi way—menacing, even. “Menacing,” he said laughing, “that’s what we go for here.” When he gardens, he said he’s been using an app called Picture This to distinguish between plant and weed, to determine what he should nurture and what he should discard.I mean, you could see this analogy coming a mile off, but a designer working on a collection isn’t so very different. For spring 2025, that flora theme, the one he tended, was evident in his silhouette, which he worked and worked and worked. What this theme gave him was the opportunity yet again to push the atelier as to what it could magic up. There were the likes of a deftly constructed black jacket from its pinched (his word) waist secured by a single pearl button before blooming upward to wide shoulders like an opening flower, while hipward—the hips have been an ongoing obsession for designers this season—everything got more geometric, with curved panels jutting outward from the body. This and variations of it came with very abbreviated skirts or (perhaps more effectively, IMO) some impeccably tailored wide pants. Elsewhere, Cadwallader drew on those cross-sectional images, with a short, sculpted black dress that dramatically exploded with a turquoise flower made from layers and layers of finely wrought organza.Yet as with all gardening projects, Cadwallader was also considering the bigger picture; nothing was seen in isolation. He was also drawn, he said, to reflecting the entirety of the Muglerverse he has created, giving women (and men—there were four looks for them here) a full sweep of how he sees the house dressing them. For Cadwallader, it was a pivot from the way he has done things in the past, and given it’s the house’s 50th anniversary, it was timely. So, despite the fantasias, there was also khaki cotton drill suiting that lightly drew on Monsieur Mugler’s love of epic architecture, and denim in the form of blouson gilets and jeans with attenuated stemlike legs. “I wanted to do full looks—I can get really obsessed with the totality of them—and that’s something I wanted to push this season,” Cadwallader said. “And I wanted to be very clothing first. Mugler is quite known for its characters and personalities, and that’s not going away. The ethos of the brand and that confidence and that sensuality has to be there, but I wanted to try to put it in a very different presentation.”', 'Just when guests at Naeem Khan’s spring presentation thought the show was concluding, the lights in the Angel Orensanz Center—formerly a synagogue—suddenly turned a deep shade of green and the score from the Broadway musical Wicked began playing. The iPhones all rose up: Khan collaborated with Universal Studios to design a small capsule of Wicked-inspired looks, which will go on sale in anticipation of the November film adaptation by Jon M. Chu. “I was inspired by the Good Witch and the Bad Witch and making them glamorous—not costumey,” said Khan, who designed his signature evening gowns in shades of Elphaba green, Glinda pink, and black.Such blockbuster collaborations can often feel cheesy or like a cash-in, but here it felt unexpectedly fun. Out came a sheer tulle gown with tiered shiny green fabric—as if Elphaba was going to the Oscars—and a long-sleeve pink column gown covered entirely in cascading beaded fringe (Glinda on a regular Tuesday). They were wickedly fabulous, and if the film’s stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, don’t wear at least one of the creations to their various forthcoming premieres, it would be a crime.But it wasn’t all Wicked-mania. As usual, Khan delivered a strong assortment of refined eveningwear that was heavy on the crystals, beads, and embroidery. Many of the finishings this season were inspired by a trip he took to Sicily this summer, including Noto and Taormina. “I took a lot of inspiration from the church walls,” he said. The silvery baroque robe coat, paired with a cream silk deep-V dress, felt ornate in such a manner, as did the purple draped-chain column gown, which hung in a way that resembled a pair of curtains fit for royalty. Many of his gowns this season also featured beaded patterns of olive branches—inspired by the vineyards he visited while living la dolce vita.Sure, there was lots of sparkle, and perhaps it wasn’t the most surprising collection from Khan, but few do glitz and glamour as well as he does. There was a sense of refinement in taste level in his execution of red-carpet dressing, which can often veer into gaudy territory. Even better was his foray into menswear—a new category for the designer. His evening suits had just the right amount of razzle-dazzle, like his pinstriped suit lined with beaded fringing. “The Naeem man is flamboyant, just like my woman,” Khan said. “He’s not afraid to wear sequins.” More men shouldn’t be. Though his mandarin-collar evening coat with matte black beads provided a more subtle shine. Entry-level shimmer.', 'According to Nanushka, the paper anniversary ought to celebrate the 20th year, not the first. With spring 2025 marking the brand’s 20th anniversary, designer Sandra Sándor wanted to pay homage to both the past and the future of the Budapest label.With a collection aptly titled “Paper,” Sándor played off the idea of turning a new page, in both a literal and figurative sense. “I was looking at what Nanushka stood for in the past 20 years, and I also want to see how it is going to be relevant in the next 20 years. So it’s kind of flipping the page to the future,” she said. In a more sartorial interpretation, she crafted strips of raw-edged poplin which bore a striking resemblance to cut paper. A recurring motif, the dynamic tiered fringe rustled down the runway on skirts, dresses, and tops and was one of the show’s standouts. Sándor’s love of handcrafts appeared elsewhere in the show, like in a contrast blanket stitch, which appeared on the Origami bag and a black bra top.While she may be looking ahead, Sándor’s longstanding house codes played a key role in the collection. She returned to Hungarian Kopjafa symbols (16th century emblems that help denote identity) printed on silk scarves, embossed in leather purses, and stamped on gold coin jewelry, as well as Nanushka’s trademark Okobor vegan leather.Sándor’s prevailing sense of nostalgia helped her decide to bring the show to New York instead of Europe, where it usually shows. “I remembered this moment when I was around 16, and I was walking in SoHo and going into some stores, and that really cemented my desire to become a fashion designer,” she said. We’re all better for her decision. Between the striped knitted micro-shorts paired with a semi-buttoned blouse, floor-length green leopard print cardigan, and sloped shouldered jackets, Sándor injected a welcomed dose of Eastern European cool into New York Fashion Week.', 'The invitation for Natasha Zinko’s spring presentation arrived in the form of a chest radiograph revealing two silicone breast implants, along with a postoperative letter from the designer’s fictional medical practice. “The Plastic Clinic will not be liable for any discomfort caused,” it threatened. “In the case that you choose to pursue any kind of monetary reparations, let us remind you that our legal department is widely known for causing 12 bankruptcies.” Ouch—this would not be the holistic service that some of tonight’s showgoers had perhaps become accustomed to. To wit: A preset performance included a swarm of bandaged models admiring their reflections through the Oval Space’s industrial windows. It could have been a scene from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.Zinko is not immune to the morbid fascinations that lurk on Instagram’s Explore page, where the algorithm will often serve before-and-after photos of strangers with swollen augmentations. “People are proud of their procedures these days,” the designer said at a preview. “And they’re not afraid to broadcast the process on social media.” A series of T-shirts had been printed with “Insert Tits Here” with dotted incision lines, and supple silicone molds were inserted into half-cup bras and the back pockets of leather trousers and acid-wash jeans. (Denim is, after all, beloved for its curve-accentuating properties.) The now transparent cultural attitude toward cosmetic treatments was otherwise evoked in stiff mesh dresses with corseted panels and silicone-dipped cotton cargos that were just sheer enough to hint at impropriety. “People do this stuff to look sexy!” noted the designer.But this was Zinko’s medical madhouse, where the surgeon’s knife is not to be trusted. Doctors charged about in high-collar lab coats laced up the back like surgical greens, while inpatients hobbled behind them in double-layered jersey hoodies and tracksuit bottoms that were sutured together at all sorts of comically lopsided angles. (The word botched comes to mind.) The designer’s continued fascination with underwear—something she considers to be fashion’s most democratic item and is, coincidentally, the only thing that a person can take into an operating theater—surfaced in tote bags with waistband branding and minidresses that had been collaged from upside-down Y-fronts. Boxer shorts were sometimes used as makeshift face masks. If Zinko’s intention was to comment on these extreme vanities, then the 45 minutes we had to sit and watch content creators film videos of themselves on the catwalk before the show could begin did an equally potent job.', 'Theme-wise, Nehera’s spring collection flowed on from resort. Ladislav Zdút was focused on the Brutalist fountains that dot Bratislava’s cityscape. The concrete used to build them was represented in a custom shade of gray, used for a sheer organza pantsuit with its lining stripes revealed. The long tendrils of fountain water inspired long, narrow silhouettes: see a maxi dress made using three types of material with a black top and pleated ivory skirt. The most literal take on these timeworn edifices was a print that replicated a crack on the stone of the company’s building. The collection was called Sediments of Time.Inspiration is often best extracted, and it was the wardrobe building pieces in this offering that most impressed, such as drapey pants with a slit detail at the hem, and some great denim. A pair of jeans had a fringed side seam, so one could slip into a raw-hemmed denim top much in the way a letter slides into an envelope. Like most brands, Nehera got a bit athletic this spring, adding sports stitching to jersey pieces that were substantial to the point of almost being heavy. At times, the use of multiple fabrics in a single garment felt fussy; more intriguing were the sheer/opaque balances. As light as a French meringue, and as mouth-watering, were a series of puffy balloon tops and skirts, to be worn or as layering pieces. Maybe air is the next element the brand should explore, having splashed around in fountains for a couple of seasons now.', \"The evening of Nensi Dojaka’s summer 2025 show was a momentous one for the designer who arose, as if from nowhere, as the most visible proponent of ‘naked’ or ‘pandemic revenge’ dressing. After a year of abstaining from shows, she made her return to London fashion week, showcased her collaboration with Calvin Klein (which is available immediately) and launched her own website e-shop all in one day. “Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith!” she’d exclaimed in an interview at her studio.There are now many young women designers who are asserting different ways of framing and showcasing female bodies—the more the merrier, of course. But Dojaka’s comeback ( although she’s never really been away) was a reminder of exactly how precise, sensitive, and technically astonishing her work is. “In the collection, we have half of it that is quite organic and more floral, as always, and the other half that is a bit harsher, with more geometric lines,” she explained.Stretch tulle layering, micro-drapes and ruffles on bralettes, the architectural engineering of tiny straps with miniscule clasps—all these were visibly back in play: true to form. It’s only human nature to ask what’s new, though? There was plenty, including body-clinging knitwear dresses, some with vertical sheer/opaque stripes, and a fierce molded leather bustier dress that was a surprise—in a good way.There’s a lot more that she’s been doing off-runway that’s also surprising. Her lookbook for spring has denim, sequin body-dresses, and new fluted jersey flares. Pieces from this wardrobe are up for purchase on her website alongside the Calvin Klein collab.Dojaka has spent her time off the hamster wheel of seasonal shows to work on her Calvin Klein commission, and decelerate from the madness of growing too quickly as a young brand. She made her much-applauded show comeback into a fashion world that is actually far more understanding of designers who only show when they have something to say and not because industry expectations are forcing them on stage. And besides, the expense of showing needs to be balanced against any possible gains.Dojaka feels quite serene about this breakaway attitude. “I don’t want to put pressure on myself to do a show every season, and I just don't want to be in a position where I’m destroying my brand because I’m doing a show,” she said, pragmatically. “There are so many other things to take care of in business, and now we are really taking care of it. That’s why now,” she smiled “it feels much better.”\", 'Things are going swimmingly for Niccolò Pasqualetti, a 2024 LVMH Prize finalist. That was made clear by a confident spring collection based on the idea of water and light and/or light reflecting off water, and the sense of quiet confidence and purpose that emanated from it. The theme might have been aqueous, but the designer was definitely feeling “grounded in reality,” he said. “Sometimes [the collection] comes from imagination, but it’s always things that you can also wear. I can identify more with what I myself and people I know can wear. This sort of reality check is very important to me.”Even a quick glance at the runway images reveals the designer’s more straightforward focus. The intimate, enclosed, almost dreamlike settings of the past opened up. There was more (physical) space around the clothes, between the models, as well as a sense of a broader perspective. That doesn’t mean the clothes were “safe,” but there was a greater focus on day-to-day looks, and this offering touched on a good number of seasonal trends, like skirt-pants and sheerness. For Pasqualetti, who designs jewelry and garments, the ability to wear pieces in different ways is important; in the context of this season, you could say there were high- and low-tide options. The opening look, a sort of double shirtdress in one, can be buttoned to drape in different ways, and the chunky silver chains that appeared on asymmetrically pleated pieces can be restyled or even detached and worn as jewelry. Those chains, the designer noted, were a nod to his time in London, birthplace of punk: Not that it was a theme here, but it offered a glimpse into the eddy of the imagination, where collected experiences spin.There were surf and turf aspects to this lineup. Linen, hand-dyed with coffee, was used for roomy trousers with a wide, three-button waistband, and showed up again as sleeves on a leather bomber paired with curved khaki pants with tucked seams and snaps that adjust the fit at the hem. Upcycled suede was patchworked with leather on the front of pants with fabric backs that kept things light. A similar approach was taken with vintage denim.Pasqualetti dipped a toe into the water theme with the second look, a sharply tailored blazer shown over pants made of a filmy, nacreous, almost weightless material that conjured the transparency of jellyfish. Wet looks were created with clear sequins that revealed the skin beneath; the same sequins were applied atop a hairy-textured cotton to different effect. Glinting like light off water was a jewelry-like vest of resin with hand-macramé knots. The use of asymmetric maillots as tops was effective. A zigzagging black satin lapel edged a zebra-like print that also referenced tiger-striped shells. The collection’s most fantastical pieces featured cascades of seaweed-like ruffles, which were actually inspired by the gills of mushrooms. These unexpected transformations were wonderful examples of Pasqualetti’s special brand of alchemy and, more broadly, his fluid world of wonder.', 'You’ve just gotten home from the club. On the way to your apartment, you stopped by the corner deli and picked up a sandwich—if you’re one of the lucky ones who lives by a deli that’s open that late. Let’s say it was a classic New York chopped cheese. So you sit on the couch and settle down to feast. Cut to the next morning: You wake up, foil wrapper next to you and still in last night’s clothes. It’s all good—you didn’t lose your phone, it just needs charging, and your clothes are only a little wrinkly.When Neil Grotzinger started working on their spring lineup, the theme evolved into a survey of the city’s nocturnal animals. Not vampires, Batman, or Amy Adams in that one great Tom Ford film, but those deeply embedded in club and rave culture who feel most at home when the lights are off and the music is going oontz-oontz-oontz.Grotzinger engineered their silhouettes to create an impression of heftiness at the hems without necessarily adding weight. This came in the shape of godets inserted into the skirts of billowy clubby dresses or pant legs, which also featured a panel connecting both legs from under the crotch to enhance that illusion of weight. The result of these experiments was sometimes grotesque but always charming and creaturelike, an oxymoron that, as it often goes with Grotzinger, was nothing but intentional. “I wanted to create a creature proportion in response to how heavy and intense this [party] culture has gotten,” they said, “to the point where going to Basement [an underground techno club in Maspeth, New York] or something is a sort of ceremony.” It can be cathartic to experience so much time on the dance floor, the designer explained. There are certainly more unconventional places where one can have an epiphany.Another goal with the architecture of the season’s silhouette was to create the illusion that these creatures are leaning forward ever so slightly. You know the way some techno people dance, moving mostly their torso and wiggling their arms but are static with their feet? That same kind of chaotic yet repetitive movement was what Grotzinger tried to emulate with these bottom-heavy bottoms. The result was playful and a little severe, and it worked.The prints in this collection featured photos Grotzinger captured while on their own nighttime adventures. There was a glass case of poppers, the kind New Yorkers can find at sex shops and now the occasional deli, sitting next to blurry lights taken during Uber rides home and buildings under construction. What Grotinzger was getting at here was profiling the irrational reality of these nightlife dwellers and the contrasts between their lives in and after the club.Back to our opening scene; Grotzinger pressed and stitched down the creases and wrinkles that would occur had their models slept in the clothes. The button shirts were the most successful pieces in the collection, as familiar as they were puzzling. Natural when you’re in them, but strange for an outsider—not entirely different from the cult that is nightlife.', 'Nili Lotan spent part of her summer in Marbella. “All I wanted to wear were dresses,” the designer, known for cutting a mean pair of pants, proclaimed earlier this week at a showroom appointment. And so this season Lotan made dresses, lots of them: Simple white slips in barely-there floral crochet yarns, column maxis in black ribbed knits, wide-gauge black crochet T-shirt cover ups. And then, as a compliment, she made the airiest of blouses. Frilly, ruffly, silky, and lacey, all cut ample to billow in the wind and barely caress the body.What Lotan was getting at for spring is that boho is indeed back. It was Betty Catroux, the Brazilian-born, French fashion muse of Yves Saint Laurent who the designer looked at this season for inspiration. But rather than her style, it was also her lifestyle Lotan was thinking of. The extravagant, jet-setter way of life of the late ’70s. A freewheeling spirit with a luxurious sense of chicness, contradictory as that may sound.Lotan, as she explained, is fascinated with that very decade and its characters and aesthetics—Fleetwood Mac played as the background at our appointment. Sometimes she leans more into rock ’n’ roll, and others she examines her affection for military aesthetics; this season she landed somewhere in between, somewhere she had not been in recent memory, which brought some freshness to her line—suede blouses and jackets, flared jeans with little suede lacing details, fringed jackets, and striped slacks. There was a sense of ease to this side of Lotan, a softer edge. It was certainly welcome.', 'The recap season four: Emily Cooper could be looking at a whole new life in Rome, swapping the City of Light for the City of Seven Hills, and also has decisions, decisions, decisions galore because she has to face pursuing a newfound romance with Marcello or reuniting with Gabriel. (I mean: Nice work if you can get it.) Meanwhile…. Uh-oh. Oops. Sorry! Wrong season four I am talking about here. I do of course mean Harris Reed’s fourth outing for the house of Nina Ricci. It’s Harris in Paris that we should be discussing.So, another recap then: Season number four sees Reed growing into his role really rather nicely. Backstage, he acknowledged that a lot has happened personally—his 2023 marriage, more time than he ever dreamed of spending in Paris, as well as a new home in London—and professionally and that time has given him a greater affinity with the city and what it means to be designing for it and, to some degree, in its image.“There’s still the black, the white, the bows, and the polka dots,” Reed said, “I liked the idea of not letting go where I started. Yet when it comes to doing this collection, I really think I was starting to understand who the woman was and where she was going. As someone who is between Paris and London and is always traveling, I realized it was about intention.”What that meant collection-wise is that Reed retained his love of a statement-making suit but allowed it to sigh and soften, which was a smart move; where once were super-dramatic shoulders (now they’re simply dramatic), he brought a fresh and light fluidity, adding a back-baring cowl drape to the rear of his jackets. As for his equally statement-making exuberant evening looks, where he used his much-loved polka dots on a stretch-jersey lace, he embraced greater body diversity in sizing. (Reed remains one of the very few designers in Paris willing to have that conversation—and act upon it.)He still loves the idea of clothes making an entrance. But perhaps as a sign of his increasing comfort with Nina Ricci, he rethought the pyrotechnics. Instead it might mean one trick—for instance, a plissé panel of organza that moved upward to veil the face or fanned out at the back from an otherwise svelte black evening dress.To tell the story of his season four, Reed was, he said, revisiting the era of the house from around 1962 to 1965. This resulted in the snappy belted short trenches and the equally snappy safari jackets shown, in 2025 and not 1965 style, with teeny-tiny, blink-and-you’d-miss-them shorts. Yet that’s an intriguing era to be drawn to, the period when a very done formality was about to ebb away into the freewheelin’ fluidity of the late 1960s, then ’70s, and beyond. This coming spring is coincidentally offering similar choices: liberated gauzy softness or dressed to the hilt. As for Reed, he sees no reason why you can’t have both.', 'Beneath Alessandro Dell’Acqua’s reserved demeanor lies a rebellious edge. “Fashion feels too flat, too conventional right now. There’s a reluctance to challenge or be challenged,” he remarked backstage. For spring, he drew inspiration from the images of the “modettes” in the 1960s, captured by queer Swiss photographer Karl Heinz Weinberger. With their subversive individuality, they resonated with Dell’Acqua’s ongoing quest to break free from “fashion’s predictable conventions.”As a pragmatic designer, his rebellious spirit took on a gentle and wearable form. This season, his blend of “opposites attracts”—high and low, couture and casual, sequins and canvas, bourgeois and grunge—was distilled into an edited collection with lots of covetable pieces. Modern and unfussy, yet with dashes of spark, it had charm, without feeling overworked. Dell’Acqua is a master of nonchalance.The opening look set the tone and hit a current trend: a sporty, oversized parka with a leopard-print hood layered over a cocktail dress adorned with shimmering embroidered sequined florets, paired with a football team scarf and clear high-heeled mules. This juxtaposition of styles, seen on several other runways this season, points to the apparently haphazard mix of signifiers that increasingly shapes today’s fashion codes—a meticulously curated form of stylish chaos.Dell’Acqua typically gravitates toward a palette of muted nudes and beiges, contrasted with black. However, this time he embraced vibrant hues, showcasing a bold yellow anorak paired with a soft pink pencil skirt and lipstick-red accents, as well as a hot-pink duchesse opera coat with a couture edge layered over a sequined sheath. Despite these flashes of color, the finale—a sheer black ensemble that left little to the imagination—was a clear nod to Dell’Acqua’s erotic sensibility. After all, a leopard never changes its spots.', 'Three weeks of overstimulation, under-sleeping, and air-kissing will play havoc with your immune system. As the lights went down at today’s all-purpose CDG venue, bronchial coughs ricocheted around the garage. Our eyes got familiarized with the dimness as an archetypically unfamiliar Ninomiya entity floated from backstage: Clustered around its human host was a pomegranate-like comb of cloth-covered pods illuminated from within by the dim, rosy glow of shrouded filaments. What resembled a bronze kettle or watering can rested on the host’s head.During the opening phase, Hakushi Hasegawa’s soundtrack was a series of gloopy sonic exchanges that reminded me, alongside Ninomiya’s pinkish and endearingly alien DIY shapes, of an old British kids’ show called The Clangers. A black rose outfit—black-edged mesh petals—and then a look of smaller blooms whose silver chicken-wire petals were edged with bloody red resin (a little Venus flytrap) came past. More bronze receptacles rested above.Parted-lips-shaped panels kissed their way across metal or leather harness grids worn over tulle in scarlet or black. More lip grids in leather-looking material encaged the wearers before a series of multi-belt bikers. Morning coats bisected by garter-belted cavities opened at the wearers’ guts, and then later, a leather-shoulder cloak/topcoat with a pearl-edged rib-cage detail seemed to hint at a heartbreak narrative lurking somewhere between the gloomy bouquets, kiss-smothered cages, and viral shapes. It all was a fresh verse of wearable metaphysical poetry, romantic this time, from Kei Ninomiya.', 'Yara Flinn took a trip to the Aeolian Islands this summer, where the deep blues and greens of the Tyrrhenian Sea spoke to her. “The water in Sicily inspired my color palette because it was a deep, clear emerald. You see many of those shades, like the greens and blues, shimmering in this collection,” said the designer. With those colors, she was also thinking about a wardrobe that could take her customer from day to night to fit into every part of their lifestyle.The brand’s pendant-cord belts have been a best-selling accessory at her storefront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and this season, Flinn began incorporating this detailing into her pieces as well. Shimmering white satin tank tops feature a hematite metallic pendant at the waist that can be styled in a multitude of ways, whether draping low off to the side or cinched at the front to add a focal point to the outfit. “I love adding a jewelry aspect to my pieces so that the wearer doesn’t have to worry about that detail,” said Flinn.As usual, the designer also noted her athletic background as a former basketball player and incorporated some sportier pieces, like a nylon pleated tennis skirt that gives you the comfort of sportswear while maintaining the look of more traditional options.', 'Longevity has been Norma Kamali’s hobby horse for a while now. Having explored the subject in the context of wellness, more recently she’s started considering how longevity can be related to legacy. She seems to find a way forward with technology. Armed with a certificate in generative AI from MIT and able partners, Kamali has created a proprietary AI program fed solely with images of her designs, which she decided to put to the test, asking the machine how it might iterate on an archival dress of alternating bands of black opaque and tan sheer fabric, and included the AI versions alongside the original in the lookbook.This experiment had little to do with the overall garden party (real or state of mind) theme, featuring interchangeable designs in what Kamali called “slightly off colors” of “vintage green, asparagus, baby pink and cappuccino,” that played well off each other. If only politicians could do the same: “I think about what’s going on in the world; it can’t get any more complicated than it is,” said the designer, who decided to lean into optimism by choosing “color and the light.”Not wanting customers to have to lighten their wallets, Kamali has focused on keeping prices low and thinking how her pieces can be variously combined or styled to create many different looks with few garments.The one-and-done draped Diana dress that Sarah Jessica Parker, as Carrie Bradshaw, re-popularized is still going strong. “I thought it was really enough,” Kamali said. Customers don’t agree, which led the designer to the conclusion that “you can’t just be feeling new all the time, you just can’t.” Her collections always include reissues; for spring she’s gone all in relaunching the convertible skirt, which has an interesting backstory.“When I started out,” the designer related, “I never had any training in fashion, and I realized that my pattern makers were bullying me, telling me things weren’t possible, so I said, ‘I better learn how to do this because it has to be possible.’ I learned how to make patterns myself, but my skills were limited, so all the clothes I made would be so simple.” One of these was the convertible, the star of the spring 2025 collection, which Kamali describes as “basically a square with a hole,” and which is so called because of the many different ways it can be worn.Another throwback in the collection was a slip jumpsuit with draped harem pants that was worn back in the day by the likes of Bianca Jagger and Cher. Kamali has had a lot of requests to bring it back, so she set about recreating the pattern. “So much originated in the 1970s. It was one of those new ideas times,” she mused.  That decade took many cues from the ’30s, when the bias cut was first popularized.  Kamali played a lot with this technique for spring, using clear straps to suspend an off-the-shoulder look, creating pretty necklines, and versatile skirts.', 'Off-White is a company launched by an American, based in Milan, with fashion shows in Paris. Its home-is-everywhere-and-nowhere aspect was befitting of its founder, the late Virgil Abloh, who was famously one of the industry’s most peripatetic people. And it’s what enabled his hand-picked successor Ib Kamara to bring the label to New York Fashion Week for a stateside runway show this season, unbelievably the brand’s first-ever.“It feels like coming home for Off-White and for me as well,” said Kamara backstage. Kamara, too, is in constant motion for his work; he’s also a busy stylist. The collection’s spark came from a trip he took to Ghana, the country from which Abloh’s parents emigrated. “I just loved it, so I started the collection there,” Kamara said, “going to the market, gathering fabrics, working with local artisans, really gathering a lot of feeling from it. And I named the collection Duty Free: you’ve come to New York, you’re young, you’re sexy, and you’re confident because you’re a global traveler.”Emphasis on sexy when it came to the women’s pieces. They were based on the building blocks of athletic wear, leotards and leggings, the former souped-up with v-necklines that plunged to below the navel, and the latter split at the hem over spiked sandals. Shrunken track jackets and wispy skirts formed the other major silhouette; they were accessorized with a second track jacket tied around the waist  to give the look a more low-key vibe.Kamara has a more natural feel for the men’s side, and his main idea for the guys was adding a zippered panel to the hems of vests and jackets, as well as to the front of trousers. He came out for his bow in a pair of jeans with the treatment, the unzipped panels looking like utility pockets with room for the backstage tools of the trade. There was also a letterman jacket with logo patches and a hoodie featuring the artwork of the Ghanaian artist Nana Danso.We were at Brooklyn Bridge Park’s Pier 2, home to basketball and handball courts, a skating rink, and an epic view of the Manhattan skyscrapers across the East River. The front row was just as glittering, with Flavor Flav, Zayn Malik, Mary J Blige, and Camila Cabello among the VIPs. The tennis player Francis Tiafoe, who sat front row and shares a Sierra Leonean background with Kamara, weighed in with a review: he wants everything. It was too early for Kamara to say if Off-White will stick with NYC, return to Paris, or go elsewhere in 2025, but the excitement about the brand and the goodwill for him does feel global.', 'Backstage, minutes before showtime, Ottolinger’s cofounder Christa Bösch was on her hands and knees trimming the hem off a long black dress. Out in the venue, a beached shark, its bloodied mouth agape, formed the exit to the concrete runway. Even so, the message was not intended to be gory.“It’s a symbol of fearlessness,” cofounder Cosima Gadient offered. “This is the girl who survives all the drama.” By the same token, the bands and inflated accessories on some of these silhouettes may have looked like conceptual takes on the life vest and rather restrictive ones at that. Those bands and wraps, the designers said, were conceived as an optional add-on, for example, to jazz up an evening look.Impressionistic collection notes said, “Mine is a body in transit, intimately dressed in yesterday’s party and for tomorrow’s new beginnings.” They also evoked Calypso on the half shell: “I am the shark drifting between cities, my dorsal fin splitting the world like an oyster.”Once past the neoprene leggings, the collection felt like a step forward. It focused mostly on long jersey dresses intended to move from morning to night, at times cut with twin necklines so that a shirt collar could be worn classically or shifted impertinently forward (as on the red number in Look 8). Torn and shredded as they were, the silhouettes looked more minimalist than in past outings. (“Sometimes, you have too many straps,” Gadient allowed.)Statement pieces included a body-positive short black halter dress, crystal-studded sandals, and pieces in ECCO.Kollektive, including foiled and structured car-crash jackets in crunch leather and one rather brazen riff on the most iconic of handbags (here in black or bubble-gum pink with a base dipped in tonal thermo-molded rubber). Those bags came adorned with a metal Trading Bank credit card meant to play up a woman’s financial agency. Rounding out the collection was a collaboration with Shayne Oliver on bikinis and glasses and with Shark Beauty (Barbie hair optional).', 'Our Legacy’s influence on menswear is such that editors, speaking in shorthand, describe some emerging brands as trying to be the next OL. Essentially they are talking about the legacy of Our Legacy—which includes an anti-fashion stance that embraces grunge, moto, and military influences and lends a sense of timelessness to the pieces. There’s also a muted color palette and, since the introduction of women’s, a two-way kind of androgyny. In short, effortlessness (fashion’s holy grail) imbued with cool. Some of these elements can be replicated but the power of the “Our” in the brand name cannot be overlooked. This independent label was founded by three tight-knit friends, and, in his quiet and confident way, creative director Cristopher Nying takes his own experiences and abstracts them in such a way that they are at once personal and universal.This season the abstraction was physically manifest in the lookbook in which models were photographed behind glass, at a remove, with reflections sometimes adding texture to the images. This could be read as a metaphor for modern life in a digital age, where content is consumed through a glass screen, but Nying had something different in mind.The collection’s starting point was Greek fishing villages, and photos of DIY cloth-wrapped motors taken there by Nying’s friend Hank Grüner. Beach detritus, such as grape vines, bottle caps, shell fragments, rope, and fishing lures were upcycled or cast into jewelry. Fishing nets inspired a knotted tank, and the shapes of sails made their way into wrapped skirts. Technical gear for marine life was another influence, most dramatically in a life vest-like gilet that swelled out into a peplum.Nying achieved a “wet look” in various intriguing ways. Airy crinkled sweaters were made of a mix of silk and metal threads, and a cropped white nylon jacket was washed and shrunken to create a clinging effect. There was a requisite marinière stripe created through shadow-like transparencies on a think knit. The classic sailor shirt with the flap collar was edited into a loose-fit, high-buttoning blazer with a “falling collar.” Building on the Mediterranean theme, a few of the women’s looks followed the curvy “bella figura” silhouette, but deconstructed the OL way. Ingeniously, a filmy, tied-at-the-waist skirt was is essentially an oversize T-shirt and could be worn as one. Similarly, a must-have robe coat could be worn inside-out.Nying’s imaginary fishing village is, apparently, sun-scorched as the models had artificial sun-burns. Their wet-looks could represent sweat as easily as ocean water; in fact, the glass suggested the former. The intention, Nying said, was to create the feeling of being “inside a bubble or inside a terminal. I wanted to leave it a bit open; it could be that you come inside from a very hot, dreamy place, but I still wanted it to feel like you missed the plane to this dream place and are standing in a terminal in an airport or something.” There was something dreamy about the whole scenario that verged on the surreal. This aspect of the spring lineup was captured in two surprising accessories. Referencing Donald Duck’s fishing misadventures where the catch is not a fish but an old shoe, there was a “collapsing consultant” shoe that looked like a Tom Rath-style business shoe, that could be worn as a slip on. The collection’s sunken treasure was a faceless silver watch. Breaking with Dalí, Nying’s timepiece wasn’t melting: instead time was suspended and gratification delayed—at least until this catch of a collection lands in stores.', 'Levi Palmer and Matthew Harding were fresh from a holiday at their spring 2025 preview. Their sense of R&R was palpable: It came in part from their hot summer break, and also from the fact that their business is doing well, despite the tumultuous retail landscape a lot of fashion brands are navigating right now.Having developed their once “passive” direct-to-consumer website, they’ve learned more about the people they are designing for. The most revealing and constructive feedback has come from the chat widget on their site: “It’s very easy to forget that the clothes actually have a purpose out there in the world. If you just focus on the creativity, that’s really fun for you, but not necessarily great for people to buy into,” said Harding.They know their customer inside-out. And they’re on the same wavelength: A recent trip to Paris revealed that a top client, the proud owner of 15 Palmer Harding shirts, is also a proud owner of three Richard Serra works—an artist that has inspired the designers’ methodology from the beginning. “When you have those relationships with your consumer, you really get to understand their point of view and their mindset. It’s exciting, it validates the work that you do,” Palmer remarked.How does spring 2025 fit into their customer’s wardrobe? Weekend is a word thrown around a lot in conversation, which in the context of their look book was translated via separates and dresses rendered in cotton, light-wash denim and taffeta. “Our approach is very sculptural, very hands on fabric,” says Harding of the draping methods Palmer experiments with at the start of each collection.This collection began with two semi-circles––representative of a “lover’s embrace,” inspired by their own evolving polyamorous relationship––manipulated in different ways to create new silhouettes with curved panels, their signature flounces, tied waists and fluid sleeves that trickled to the ground like waves (hence the nautical palette). “It’s not necessarily about that early, exciting kind of sexual tension,” Harding explained. “It’s this kind of almost calm realization, and almost like a knowing, in a relationship.” The epitome of their new vision was the final look: a cobalt dress with an asymmetric peplum, one of the most direct interpretations of multiple forms becoming one––kind of like Palmer, Harding and their customers.', 'Blame it on Brooklyn…. On a visit to New York last year, Alejandro Gómez Palomo, who works from his village, Posadas, in the South of Spain, was invited to a party there. “It was, he explained, “this massive, crazy, dark, underground thing and I was thinking, ‘If hell had a place on earth, it’d be exactly like this,’ but then I enjoyed myself too much and I saw so much beauty and I was so happy and so liberated that I thought, ‘Why hell? This is what we know is heaven. Everyone was happy and everyone loved each other and there were no prejudices or anything like that.’ So that was really what started me thinking on this collection and got me to [the theme of] All of Heaven’s Parties.” Building on the theme, he presented his collection at The Church of the Divine Paternity on the Upper West Side.When you think about it, it’s ironic that Palomo showed his triumphant, and rather religious spring 2024  collection, in the OTT Plaza Hotel (a place of business), and this more celebratory one in a place of worship. The designer carried over his interest in the Jazz Age and the ’30s here. Having decided to change to a one-show-a-year model, he went all-out in terms of craft. “I had my entire team, my family, my mom, my aunts… just embroidering crystals, embroidering feathers, and doing all this delicate [work] that I really enjoy making. I’ve been really, really hands-on in this collection.” That was evident in the piano-shawl-like fringe and tassels on satin tops, the siren-like finale dresses, swinging bands of beads on pants, and the incredible feather headdresses. Palomo’s charming collaboration with Bimba y Lola for spring 2024 (remember the rose bags), seemed to go into overdrive this time around. It’s not just that the designs were bolder, but they were too heavily promoted. But perhaps that’s in some way on theme.“There’s always the aspect of romance and historical reference in my work, but then there’s always a [focus on the] now, understanding…what my community is experimenting with and is doing. I love to understand how people interpret love or sexuality these days.” Having done so at that massive rave, the designer came to the conclusion that “it’s the end of romance; it’s all about sex and choosing out of a catalog.” In other words, transactional. Understanding something is different than accepting it, and so Palomo, who usually loves a narrative, countered with a collection that was, for the most part, about transcendent beauty—and glamour.', 'Paolina Russo is on a gap year for spring 2025—at least, according to this season’s mood board. It all began with a trip that Russo took to LA. “It was the first time I’ve gone as an adult, and staying on Venice Beach, there was something really positive about the lifestyle,” the designer said, describing the surfers she’d see catching waves each morning, dressed in colorful swimwear.It’s this mood that Russo and her co-founder, Lucile Guilmard, wanted to capture in their latest offering, translated quite literally into Lycra surf tops featuring bold sunburst patterns, reminiscent of the Billabong and Roxy designs you’d find in the late ’90s and early ’00s. Beachwear is a new category for the London-based label best known for its knitwear: There was a brightly printed chiffon minidress, a sarong, and the brand’s first bikinis. Elsewhere, babydoll tops tapped into the boho revival that’s happening right now.While the searing color palette of neon pink and lime green won’t necessarily be to everyone’s taste, it’s clear that Russo and Guilmard approached this collection with a real sense of freedom. “It’s super important to keep this process of experimentation; it’s the thing that makes us excited about our job and motivates us to keep going,” Russo said. The duo, who aim to highlight a new craft each season, worked with artisans in Peru to create a hippieish crochet hoodie and Bermuda shorts, while jeans featuring handwoven lattice detailing were naturally dyed.Above all, though, the pair wanted to bring some much-needed joy into all of our lives via the medium of clothing. “We had a lot of fun making this collection,” Guilmard said. That positive Paolina Russo energy shone through—this season more than ever.', 'In all of London Fashion Week, the tiniest, almost-off-grid, lowest-budget, handmade happening that Paolo Carzana held in his back garden will surely be chalked up as one of those magically significant moments that people talk about for years.This was in Carzana’s rented, shared flat in a terraced suburban house in East London—a very far cry from Kensington, where the official LFW wrap party was about to take place on glamorous roof gardens. Martine Rose has been famous, and loved, for taking large international audiences off to experience London neighborhoods, of course. But Carzana went even beyond that: just 70 guests packed on benches around the backyard that his parents had spent August clearing. He’d turned his and his boyfriend’s bedroom into the prep room, persuaded the landlord it would be okay, and asked the neighbors if they’d help with lighting from their windows. Down the road, the local pub got involved by hosting the hair and makeup team.He didn’t do it to be snobby or exclusive, he said, but because “I feel so out of place with all this idea of coolness. I just care about the clothes and the making and the creation of it. It’s also an attempt, I guess, to try to make everyone understand how special these moments are for us in fashion. To completely remove the smoke and mirrors and show, and make your own miracles.”Just after dusk, a poignant succession of people in fragile, knotted, plant-dyed tatters walked slowly through his back door. The first, a lad wearing a bunched-up shirt, gray trousers, and a draped medieval-seeming cap, walked down the garden steps, knelt in front of a pond, and paused to gaze at his reflection.He was striking the classical pose of Narcissus, of course. Carzana had seen Caravaggio’s painting of the boy who fell in love with the sight of himself in a pond. But the opening of this ethereal drama was different from the original legend because, while making clothes that you’ve never seen before, Carzana is also a writer of his own mythologies and a spinner of hope in precarious, frightening times.It was his metaphor for the source of today’s dystopian reality: “This is reflective of the hell that we’re living in. This complete move to that old, old sentiment of humanity, of vanity, of caring about what you look like, and not caring about the world around you. There are so many really awful wars and hunger, and endless, endless reasons to give up, really. It’s so hard to keep optimistic.” So, in Carzana’s world, the narcissist was going to look at himself in a redemptive way. “How can we understand our own intentions in contributing to global warming, in contributing to all these things that are wrong?” he said. “It’s how we have to look at ourselves in the mirror, but be honest about our own contribution, and then from there, hopefully we can move forward in unison.”', 'Eleven Parsons students presented the MA collections they completed for their graduation last spring. “They’re all so individual, ” said Ben Barry, dean of the school of fashion, when asked if there were through-lines among the students. Form your own conclusions, he suggested. When reviewing the portfolios of the bachelor’s program in May, I had noted an interest in post-humanism. That’s too strong a description of the preoccupations of the master’s students, but almost everything, including the human form, was exaggerated. We saw some cubist distortions at the fall 2024 couture, and they were also present here, often in the form of jutting triangular shapes. For the most part these clothes created a distance between the wearer and other people.The anthropomorphism of Sijia Lyu’s work, which included clothes that resembled garment bags and chairs, called to mind a literary genre popular in the 18th century, it narratives, in which stories were told from the perspective of objects. Especially clever was her cable-knit sweater—the cables made of coiled telephone cords. Yue (Cassie) Xu, was similarly interested in home objects; note her leather “Chesterfield” skirt. Segueing into the realm of fiction was Yunhao Liao who created stuffed animal mascots to accessorize his tailored looks. Ziqi Zhen, who collects ball-jointed dolls, softened her futuristic/armor like silhouettes, complete with arm joints, with giant, 3D-printed flowers. Murder She Wrote could have been the title of Jiaying (Kaei) Wang’s menswear line up. The designer is also an illustrator and her garments featured bull’s eyes, “bullet holes,” resin-blood-spattered shoes, and a bleeding heart. Liying Zheng brought her training in oil painting to play in tulle dresses in delicious color combinations. More literal were paint-stained pants and a coat featuring a functional slot for an oil paint brush as well as a 3D zippered box at the back.Moving in a more political direction was Margarida Feijão, whose pieces exaggerated the hourglass silhouette, often in plaster. In her bio the Portuguese designer said that her practice is built on “merging wearable art with critical social commentary.” Photographs of nature collided with silver metallic lacquered leather in Nan Yu’s collection, the starting point for which was her upbringing “in a steel city surrounded by forests in China.”Of particular note were three menswear collections that dealt, respectively with ideas of play (Patrick Taylor), streetwear, and queer culture (K.S. Tehara), and streetwear (Mohan Li). The latter completed her undergraduate at Beijing Institute of Fashion and Technology, and has written that she is interested in capturing Chinese youth culture. Post-show she stated that her aim with this collection was to meld sports and streetwear. She used her pattern-cutting skills to create five-point star shapes on casual jackets and pants. One pair of jeans had detachable knitted legs, another track-style pair came with matching zip on/off shoe covers. Using word graphics is a signature of her work, a way, she explained, to play with the idea of “statement dressing.” Taylor, a knitwear designer from London, approached play with a kind of childhood innocence. He used foam to create silhouettes of almost comic proportions that referenced skiing and sailing. The idea was to almost freeze the body in motion, for example, a pair of tartan knit pants had the appearance of bent knees even when the model was standing tall. Charming indeed was a sweater with toy soldiers. Perhaps not intended for audiences of all ages were Tehara’s penis bags, made by 3D printing with wood scraps. The designer, who got his BA at Central St. Martins, made his entire collection from existing materials, and all of the pieces, he said after the show, were produced by himself and friends over a few bottles of wine. Highlights of his collection include a crochet T-shirt made of sari fabric and a waxed, upcycled doublet jacket worn with hand-felted shorts. Tehara wanted to speak to the importance of crafting spaces for queer culture to thrive in, he said.The show format was unusually inclusive: for the sight-impaired there was an emcee who described the room and the particulars of each look, from material to silhouette and style of shoe, using write-ups provided by the students.', '“This season there was really a feeling to cut the noise and pull back,” said designer Nellie Partow during an appointment at her Manhattan studio. The result was a surprisingly sensual collection in a strict color palette of black and white. To wit, the sheer knit mesh bodysuit, paired with a matching skirt that opens the lookbook. A closer look revealed a subtle geometric pattern in the knit, as if the needles had skipped, which added interest. But Partow hasn’t abandoned the real working women that love and buy her clothes; the second look showed the real life way of wearing the bodysuit, layered over a white T-shirt, with a pair of black jeans, and a white tailored blazer nipped at the waist.The collection was very simple: pleated baggy Bermudas had instantly cool appeal, as did two-tone swingy knit skirt, bodysuits, and a narrow, high waist trouser. A couple of great dresses, including a strapless, A-line number, were made from a cotton fabric woven with metal which resulted in a crinkly texture that has the touch of linen. The A-line dress was also recreated in a mix of cotton shirting fabrics—using the basketweave usually reserved for men’s tuxedo shirts—that created a subtle contrast. The same mix was prevalent in Partow’s shirting series, where she often uses these specialty cottons to create contrast on a collar, a cuff, or a back yoke.', 'Guillaume Henry called his collection “Rose,” but it wasn’t just an exercise in color or floral forms, although there were a few bursts in evidence in this spring outing for Patou.Instead, the designer said, his Rose is a composite portrait of the women who have inspired him. She could be any one of a number of feminine—and feminist—characters in French film, for example the Beirut-born French actress Delphine Seyrig, among many others unfamiliar to non-French audiences. “I wanted to channel a softness and a return to elegance, and as it happens the name Rose is very French and also very international,” Henry noted, adding, “she’s chic, and she’s efficient about it.”On the runway, the designer mixed up signatures associated with Jean Patou—pleated skirts, dropped waistlines, midi lengths—with those of his predecessors: Karl Lagerfeld, Michel Goma, whose work Henry considers unjustly forgotten, and Christian Lacroix, whose famed pouf skirts he revisited here in a leggy millennial iteration. A couple of safari-inspired jackets, with wide belts and wider lapels, looked like they might gain commercial traction; ditto the sporty 1970s-style polos embroidered with a scaled-down version of the ‘JP’ logo. Other pieces–like a scallop-edged top and shorts informed by provençal boutis embroidery, well-cut jeans with a white top and black jacket, and a four-pocket shift with gold buttons–could be swiped straight from the runway to the streets of Paris or anywhere else. That chunky gold heart necklace, too, will likely be a hit by the time spring rolls around.By the designer’s own admission, the thing about French film and women in love is that their plotlines are virtually impossible to summarize neatly. The ones he had in mind here turn on hope and forging ahead. Henry has been handed (another) hard remit here, so–to his credit–the same could be said about him.', 'When Paula Canovas del Vas was casting around for a presentation concept, she stumbled across The New York Times’s viral “36 Questions That Lead to Love” article. Reading the questions struck a chord, so she asked the artists Meryl Yana and J.B. Braud to narrate them, and that became the soundtrack for a presentation held in the ballroom at the Cervantes Institute in Paris. It also begat a five-minute film by Braud, entitled It Was Just a Background Noise.The show opened with a friends-and-family group of performers all wearing corporate suits; gradually, models emerged and insinuated themselves into the circle, wearing sequined dresses with pouf shoulders or little mesh numbers printed with bright colors.The exercise was about the power dynamics inherent in every relationship, the designer said. She name-checked the work of psychologist Arthur Aron, who demonstrated how self-disclosure can create closeness between strangers.Dressed in fuchsia for the occasion, she said, “I wanted to explore this idea of belonging versus standing out from the crowd.” Fleshing out the flip side of that equation was her mother, who donned a suit to perform but also contributed the handmade head bows, hats, and sunflower earrings.If the result all skewed a bit bridal, right down to the meringue dress and that macarena number, it was all intentional. Though restrained, it also felt like a step forward: more sophisticated and yet still distinct.“I’m renewing my vows to the fashion industry, in a way,” Canovas del Vas mused. She is, after all, only in her third season in Paris and therefore still a newbie by every possible measure. The long, long journey of commitment has barely begun. “People think it’s all about models and a show when in reality it’s about moving forward without looking at what other people are doing,” she said. “I can say that you encounter all kinds of things they never teach you about in school.”', 'On a trip to Japan 10 years ago, Pauline Dujancourt was transfixed by seeing people tie votive wishes and prayers outside temples in the ema tradition. “I didn’t want to be disrespectful, but I wrote my own in my notebook and saved it,” she said. It read: “I wish to be a fashion designer.”She’s made that wish come true by sublimating her affinity for knitwear and crochet into her own poetic art form.Her first live presentation at London Fashion Week was a conceptual celebration of the moment that set her on the path that, so far, has made her an LVMH Prize finalist and won her orders from a clutch of boutiques and luxury stores.A group of models wearing her delicate collection of dresses, cardigan jackets, and skirts moved to and fro, engaged in a ritual of attaching tiny strips of text to a large knitted net. It was a smart close-up way of transmitting the sensual mixed-media attraction of her signatures: cream and soft lichen green constructs of baby-fine yarns, draped ruchings of fabric, organza ribbons, and tiny rouleaux bow-fastenings.Dujancourt, who is French, emerged with this fully formed proposition after graduating from the École Duperré School of Applied Arts in Paris. She first crossed the channel to work as a knitwear designer for Simone Rocha and Rejina Pyo, then decided to take her MA at Central Saint Martins. Now she’s a fully fledged member of London’s creative class of women designers—every one with her own take on female self-expression and values. The care Dujancourt takes extends to working with a collective of women hand-knitters and crochet specialists in Lima, Peru, as well as artisans in France and the UK, which makes her gentle aesthetics even more beautiful to behold.', 'Petar Petrov’s clothes are the kind that whisper rather than shout: Meticulously crafted from the world’s finest fabrics, and always offering just the right amount of directional flair, his collections are designed entirely on his own terms at his studio base outside the four fashion capitals in Vienna. So it was a delight to see him lean into his more playful instincts this season, thanks to a deliberately absurd look book that showcased not only his fantastic clothes, but also his wry sense of humor.Just take the opening look: one of Petrov’s signature oversized leather jackets, here with slits at the side so it can be belted and customized according to the wearer, styled with just a pair of stilettos and two enormous baguettes stuffed through the shoulder epaulettes. Elsewhere, you’ll find models clutching bananas like pistols, posing with lettuces and gourds strewn by their feet, and balancing tomatoes on their heads. “Fashion doesn’t always need to be serious,” Petrov says with a grin over Zoom. “I think we need to see everything with a bit more lightness, with a bit more joy, and not be afraid of people saying they don’t like something. We should never be afraid to fail, and I think, at the moment, it’s really important to grab the customer in a more emotional way.”If there’s one thing Petrov’s loyal clientele feels towards his clothes, it’s a sense of emotional attachment—and they’ll find plenty to fall for here: breezy shirtdresses cut from sand-washed silk featuring adjustable bands at the waist to be worn higher or lower, or draped on the fly; a coat dress with a cape-like detail at the back that managed to be both feminine and strangely powerful; a new version of a hoodie that debuted last season, cut in a circular shape to protectively cocoon the body. There was plenty of killer tailoring too: not least a fabulous black blazer, styled here with a floral brooch, that featured dramatically oversized pockets that become part of the silhouette.It’s all part and parcel with Petrov’s broader philosophy, which offers a 360-degree wardrobe that can be built over the seasons, thanks to the designer’s keen consideration of how each collection will dovetail with pieces from years past. “I always see the collection as an evolution, from season to season,” he says. “The weather makes things challenging—there aren’t really winter and summer collections anymore. You can have snow in May, but you can have also 30 degrees in April. So at the moment, the seasons need to be redefined a bit.” It’s a conclusion he reached after talking to—and trying on the clothes with—the women in his studio. “For me, it’s always interesting to be inspired by my friends, clients, and what the women around me want to wear,” he adds.The word that recurred most often throughout our conversation was “generosity:” generosity of proportion, generosity of the fabric in its drapes and twists, and the broader generosity of clothes that never feel uptight. Yet that didn’t stop Petrov from bringing in a few bolder moments at the end of the collection to reflect the more outlandish styling of the look book: a final look featured a hooded silk blouse and denim trousers in slightly different shades of a sumptuous burnt orange, like a sartorial tequila sunrise. “Personally, I like more muted colors, but I wanted that freshness this time,” Petrov says. “I wanted to let in the sunlight.”', 'Peter Do’s spring show took place at Paris’s Musée Guimet, home to one of the largest collections of Asian art outside of Asia. While it jibed with the designer’s Vietnamese roots, it was a choice not short on ambition. Seats sneaked around century-old statues and intricately carved portals; on each chair, press notes were paired with text (a poem? an essay?) written by Korean American author Mary H.K. Choi, along with a Bangkok guide featuring the favorite spots of designer Philip Huang, who had assisted Do in researching ancestral indigo-dyeing techniques in northern Thailand. Guest were gifted a bottle of 000, a custom scent created for the occasion. It was quite the production. A live performance capped off the show, continuing well after it had ended.The dyes, made from leaves, tree bark, and earth and activated by fire, water, and air—as Do explained backstage—produced irregular ombré patterns on gauzy fabrics, from which the designer crafted a few standout pieces, including a men’s bomber and two women’s slender coats, for the show’s finale. Bookended by these artisanal looks and the opening designs, which played on Do’s repertoire of fluid deconstruction, the collection struggled for a cohesive rhythm. Shredded denim and sweats alternated with sporty black satin puffers layered over tailored suits from a new line called 168; long men’s shirts, made from poplin or cotton with a crumpled-paper texture, were worn askew across the torso, while a Vietnamese-style lithe tunic in dark green chiffon with abstract prints (one of the collection’s uncomplicated, finest pieces) was layered over matching slender trousers.Do tried to pull out all the stops to make his Paris outing worthy of all the effort (and investment) he had clearly put into it. However, while the city offers global visibility to press and buyers, it’s far from an easy platform for a young brand to navigate, despite its apparently welcoming and generous reputation.', 'There are two ways to take in PH5’s spring collection: At face value (colorful and quirky); or really getting into the weeds. The location, the threatened Elizabeth Street Garden, suggested that Wei Lin and Zoe Champion were hoping you’d take the latter option and be inspired to get your hands dirty metaphorically, or in the soil. The brand is leading by example: the engineered knits are no-waste and, explained Champion, “95% of the collection is recycled or sustainably sourced materials.” In addition, PH5 plants a tree for every garment sold or produced. With a mission of moving people from talk to action on climate change, this was a deliberately purposeful collection.The idea, which didn’t really come across, was to show the many ways, besides marching, that people can get involved. Paint-throwing extremism makes the news in ways that permaculture and “quiet craftivism—the sewing and knitting circles where people come together to have conversations and spark a moment” do not. Gardening is another option which was suggested by utilitarian trompe l’oeil looks that mimicked a chore apron with flowers in the pockets. Some models carried dried flowers, others sported gardening gloves.Combining knits and wovens is a fairly new practice for the brand and they really leaned into it for spring 2025, with nylon backed garments, full looks, and best, knits with fabric bubble hems, as in look three.The brand’s figure enhancing knits were included in the show and there were flowers, landscape, and frog prints as well two tops that need explaining; one that read “Save the Ugly Animals,” and another which looked like it was depicting nipples, but which were actually the eyes of a frog. One of the places Champion has visited is Lake Titicaca in the Andes on the border of Bolivia and Peru, where she spent time with the indigenous Uru people. “They build reed islands,” and have done so since pre-Inca times, said Champion, and “the lake is now threatened by climate change.” As a result, one of its amphibious habitants, popularly known as the scrotum frog, is endangered. It has also appeared, the designer continued, “on a list of the ugliest animals in the world. So this season we want to say, ‘Save the Ugly Animals.’ People always fundraise for polar bears and koalas and penguins, the cute animals.”Besides the backstory there was a lot going on in this collection in terms of motifs, knit/fabric mixes, different types of stitches, and the odd addition of what looked like crochet raffia. The show format supported the theme better than it did the clothes, which individually were engaging. Polos are having a moment and PH5 had actual and trompe l’oeil versions, but they were often layered under dresses. Overall the line-up felt decorative and various rather than functional and focused. Swimwear might have fit in with the lake theme, and the sporty, tennis-style dress that Lin wore to take her bow was a reminder of the potential PH5 has in the sports category. In fact pieces from the brand’s relaunched PH5+ activewear line were included in the show, but not in a way that called them out. This season was instead dedicated to moving the needle on climate change forward.', 'Philipp Plein showcased his spring 2025 collection within his new Plein Hotel, placed right in front of the Indro Montanelli Gardens in the center of Milan. This glamorous location will be open to the public in November, with its four restaurants and 13 rooms. Plein’s passion and dedication for this new project were palpable when, just before the show, he gave a brief welcome to the crowded spaces. Then, with club music perfectly matching the atmosphere, the first look came out to confirm what the German designer defined as an “evolution of style, always faithful to the maximalism of the brand and truthful to its aesthetic, yet being able to change to stay relevant for 25 years.”Tailoring was a main theme, with many Prince of Wales proposals such as suits and separates often bedazzled with Swarovski crystals creating flame motifs. But double-breasted suits were also presented in a monochromatic version and sleek silhouettes, a contemporary option of daily looks. Within this category there were many denim pieces, made of ripped jeans paired with metallic blazers or chic tweed jackets, including outerwear such as distressed trench coats.Ski-inspired sunglasses created a contrast with evening proposals like elongated sequined gowns and floating pleated dresses, together with the ones with a touch of pop represented by a Lurex cherry print. That print in a minidress was upgraded to a full-paillettes version. Crystals are never enough at a Plein show, even for a more demure one such as this season’s. In fact, a shiny monogram recurred on blousons, while streetwear ensembles in full denim were encrusted with shiny beads, and wide pants were decorated to create a sparkling argyle motif.', 'Fashion may not have the power to solve the world’s vast array of challenges or bring an end to the senseless cruelty and inhumanity that seem to pervade our surroundings. However, as Lorenzo Serafini suggests, it holds the potential to provide a brief escape—a moment of relief from the overwhelming harshness we face. “Fashion can still offer a glimpse of beauty, creativity, and hope, allowing people to find comfort, if only for a short while, in a more imaginative and uplifting reality,” he said backstage.Today’s collection exuded a sense of calm that will certainly soothe the senses of the women lucky enough to get one of the collection’s many desirable pieces. Languid, light silhouettes in a palette of neutral tones convey a feeling of quiet ease. Describing it as “peaceful escapism,” Serafini explained that the designs were inspired by serene environments, where the mind can find solace and stillness.The opening looks stood out—a series of flowing, finely pleated ensembles with draped bodysuits and long skirt pants slit at the front that moved sensuously. “It’s fashion in slow motion,” said Serafini. The same liquid, finely pleated fluidity ran throughout the collection, contrasted by voluminous, round-shaped dresses with pouf sleeves and a striking series of sleek black ensembles that brought the show to a more dramatic close.Serafini is a sensitive designer; he shines brightest when he strikes a balance between modernity and romance—and here, he succeeded. In a time where grace is often overlooked, he deserves kudos for delivering a collection so rich in this undervalued quality.', '“It felt really right to do something fundamentally about love and strength,” said Phoebe English. “And the sort of sanctuary we can find when things are very dark and externally frightening.” In her last collection, the heart motif cropped up in the form of an almost-Victorian chocolate-boxy padded tie-on breastplate. This time, it multiplied all over; with tiers of hearts, latticed and suspended on tapes, forming whole garments. A romantic touch which is readable in more than one way.On the emotional front, her outpouring of hearts is connected to the fact that she had a baby daughter this summer—her second. On the technical one: Much of the collection is refashioned from leftover silks which English takes off the hands of local bridal businesses in London. Every last scrap, no matter how small, is put to use by English as part of her zero-waste practice. And anyway, Phoebe English is quietly building up her own wedding business. “Yes, we’ve made some people’s wedding dresses, and we’d like to do more,” she smiled.Treating existing textiles as precious resources is only one aspect of English’s holistic non-planet-extractive methodology. Transforming “waste” into beautiful things is often down to inventive techniques, like the garments she constructs mathematically from rectangles. The result is half-collaged and almost origami-like, with seams left breezily half-open. You might be surprised to learn that they’re made from hotel bed linens. The minimal stitching, meanwhile, is an aesthetic derived from figuring out how to use the least amount of thread possible, and therefore also the least amount of sewing machine electricity.Those who go to Phoebe English clearly follow her enlightening and excellently-communicated ways of converting troublesome things into uplifting solutions. That goes for the soft yellow-to-gold shades in this collection—which were dyed from Ragwort. “It’s a weed that grows on the margins of fields. It’s just removed or sprayed by farmers because it’s toxic to horses and livestock; but it’s a really good dye plant.” Instead, English worked with a farm in Warwickshire which hand-pulled trucks of the stuff, which she then processed into a vat of dye. Her spectrum of color—intense to pale—came from dunking the fabrics in the vat, down to the last diluted drop.Nothing in her lovingly hand-crafted world goes to waste.', 'Carolina Castiglioni launched Plan C men’s alongside women’s at this year’s Pitti Uomo. The artsy installation was conceived with longtime collaborator Duccio Maria Gambi, a designer and sculptor who has worked with Castiglioni on the set-up of the label’s stores in Tokyo. Japan is a big market for Plan C, as the country’s edgy aesthetic resonates with the streamlined codes Castiglioni has infused into her brainchild. “In Japan, men have been buying from our women’s collection, so I thought it was time to give them proper attention and a dedicated offer,” she said.Castiglioni’s personal style has been the template around which she has built Plan C from day one; being partial to a certain boyishness and to sophisticated workwear, it was rather easy to pick references from the label’s archive that will suit a guy’s wardrobe also. Uniforms and functionality remained favorite key elements; tailoring with a relaxed edge, as well as the generous volumes of sporty outerwear were proposed for both genders.Indulging her affinity for artistic expression, the designer worked on a range of boxy tops and tunics in white canvas, one of the collection’s standouts. On their fronts, she reproduced a series of paintings made from photographs she took of her daughter Margherita, whose childish self-portrait scribbled at school serves as the label’s logo. As the saying goes, the apple never falls far from the tree.', 'It was business as usual at Polo, where the design team was continuing its exploration of Ralph Lauren’s signature Americana. For spring it was injected with a slight nod to traveling and to exploration—whether to far-flung destinations or simply, the Cape. A short-sleeve dress with an asymmetrical draped hem in an indigo floral print, tie-dye cable-knit sweaters, and madras plaids, complemented by easy denim in both light and dark washes, were asking for warm summer days in a tropical setting. Elsewhere, practical khaki separates—including a terrific pair of jodhpur-esque pants with a wrap waist, and a handsome simple suede jacket—hinted at fantasies of travel made accessible by simply dressing the part.There was a bit of a ’90s undercurrent in the lookbook; not the grunge ’90s or the minimal ’90s, but the new American working woman ’90s. An undersung yet no less visually rich moment in time when ties and vests ruled. And guess what, it was a really great-looking proposition—whether the oversized Oxford worn with a nature-print tie and layered underneath a light blue cotton vest, the navy Hawaiian floral tie worn with a silk blouse, a double breasted navy blazer with gold buttons and red Hawaiian print surf shorts, or the knit Yves Klein Blue tie worn with a yellow linen shirt (with turquoise Polo insignia). Cardigans made from signature pique Polo shirt material were a hip update to a classic style, while the color palette—which added acid yellow, kelly green, and the purest reds and blues to the collection—added a bit of razzle-dazzle. Boxing-style sneakers in both a lo-top and hi-top style had the capacity to become a runaway item next season, ditto the carry-all leather shopping bags that will be available in a myriad sizes and colors.', 'Though Ponte seems to have arrived on the scene fully formed, the pieces you see here are described as its third “series” and were created by one Harry Pontefract, an elusive Englishman who views this project as “ongoing body of work” that dates back to his days at Central Saint Martins when he was up all through the night making and taking orders for one-off pieces made out of old suitcases and his mother’s linens and then going “in for a crit’ at 6AM and being shouted at for not having enough work,” as he put it on a call. Selling those pieces helped toward tuition, and the artist remembers those times as being thrilling, if challenging. Post graduation he landed in Paris where he spent time at Loewe before returning to London and returning his attention to Ponte.Harry shares the name Pontefract with a town in West Yorkshire. The origins of this moniker are Latin and it translates to “broken bridge,” which feels somehow significant in light of the fact that the designer is breaking with tradition in his multidisciplinary approach to Ponte, which might find expression as fashion or music or art or some combination of the above. “Contradictory” seems to be one of Pontefract’s favorite words—and state of being. He might describe a look as “pure sex” or “our sort of a Chanel Catherine Deneuve suit” or “the most wrong cocktail dress in the world,” but at the same time he values open endedness and believes that how people “read” his designs reveal much about themselves.Pontefract’s work is a bridge, not to nowhere, but into a world with no fixed coordinates. Yet it does have some constants; the designer is interested in creating characters. Physicality and a sculptural sense are present. Exactitude (note the carefully misplaced shoulders or the artfully undone waistbands, which are attached to carefully sourced jock straps) is balanced by spontaneity. Look one, and others, were made in the studio with fleeces delivered from known sources. Shearling came from a business down the street from the designer, the textile used for the pink shirt and pants is the lining of military sleeping bags, and the second look was from vintage M65 army jackets. Pontefract reveals himself to be a man of keen sensitivity: “Once you start to take them apart and they have the memories of whoever’s been wearing them in all the seams and everything, they’re such loaded garments. Even just doing something in that color, never mind out of old jackets, is going to be loaded…” At the same time, he said, “I think there’s a tenderness there and a frailty about doing such a generic archetype, which I love. I find it beautiful, the banality of [this look] next to something like the first look especially, and I guess if you want to go into it, I’m sure they do relate to me in the sort of brutality of both of them.”', 'Apolitical Prabal Gurung is not. During the last presidential election cycle, for spring 2020 Gurung posed the question: Who gets to be an American? This time around the question might be, Can a woman of Jamaican and Indian heritage become America’s first female president? It was clear what Gurung hopes the answer will be even before he took a bow in a T-shirt that read VOTE on the front and Harris/Waltz on the back: Note the minidress with a beaded coconut tree and the brown-and-white “coconut paillettes” (look 9).The state of America had been weighing heavily on Gurung’s mind, he explained in a pre-show interview. Asking himself when was the last time he felt free, Gurung found an answer in the Hindu festival of Holi, a celebration of color, love, and spring. One of the customs of this celebration is the throwing of colored powders. The collection was well underway when Harris became the Democratic nominee, but Gurung, who has dressed the Vice President on several occasions, found a way to mix politics and piety, by sending a cadre of models in “suffragette” white out at the end of the show. Perhaps it was the wind, but the pink pigment that was thrown into the air, presumably to color the garments, left hardly a mark on the clothes. Several crystal beaded numbers (looks 24 and 25) give a better idea of the desired splatter effect. That was also the intent also of a double-faced print with splashes on one side and polka-dots on the other.The marriage of Eastern and Western clothing tradition is a constant preoccupation for Gurung, one that he explored especially beautifully for spring 2024, and which he returned to this season starting with look one, denim/wool sari pants paired with a pleated tank. There were shorts versions and sherwani-inspired jackets. Of note were the sari/Grecian hybrid gowns that play with the earthy goddess look that is very much of the moment. Taking things in another, more classically American direction were bubble-skirted numbers and a printed set, mini dress and coat, that owed something to Bill Blass, where Gurung worked for a time.Maybe it’s because the designer has launched Prabal Gurung Atelier, the dressy looks were, happily, less grand. Even more encouraging is to see how the designer employs craft to zhuzh-up pieces that could fit into, or are inspired by, a daytime wardrobe. There were sharp denim trousers, and any number of floaty tops, some tank-shaped. The suiting was strong and the sheer-to-opaque knits were a nice surprise. Note must be made of all the handwork that went into the pieces, notably the light-as-air chiffon plissés. While there were many beautiful individual pieces, the collection would have benefited from a tighter edit. It was easier to suss out where Gurung stands politically than to take away a clear point of view from this line up; still his message of hope and optimism came through loud and clear.', 'As usual, Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons have exquisite timing. Just days after Meta (rather belatedly and in the face of growing pressure) announced new settings and features for the Instagram accounts of teen users, the designers are raising their own skeptical eyebrows about the pervasiveness of “the algorithm.”Backstage, Prada astutely observed, “basically it seems that we are directed by algorithms, so anything we like and anything we know is because other people are instilling it into us.” She made it clear that she wasn’t condemning or even critiquing the situation. As the creative leaders of a global brand, she and Simons can’t simply abstain—the appearance of South Korean boy band Enhypen and the throngs of fans waiting outside for them were “blowing up our phones,” as the kids like to say. But gauging by the looks that came down the runway, I’d argue that Prada and Simons have some reservations about Filterworld, as the writer Kyle Chayka has described the flattening effect of these platforms in a book of that name.This was the most bonkers Prada show in some time, one with a superhero-from-outer-space streak, thanks to the goggle hats and porthole skirts, with additional touches of BDSM and cowboy Americana in the form of skirts suspended from harnesses and another trimmed with long white leather fringe. Meanwhile, it was built on a foundation of sportswear—sportswear that could almost be called straightforward save for the integrated wire that gave shirt collars and hems their askew angles and the trompe l’oeil belts implanted in trousers a couple of inches below the waist. Every shoe was different, and nearly all of them appeared to be revivals of popular styles from past collections.That archival element aside, there was no throughline, and that was entirely the point, even if it was discombobulating to the audience (as I overheard afterward) as well as to Prada herself. “I was very, very nervous for this show, much more than usual,” Prada said. “It was a different approach; instead of having three or four themes for the season, we were trying to do the whole in our way.”The best designers are the ones who not only respond to and mirror their times, but provide us with some sort of projection, a future vision for how fashion—and the greater culture—could be. Prada and Simons seem to be arguing for a world with more “main character energy,” to use another internet-y turn of phrase, and more individual style. With fashion succumbing to quiet luxury blandness and online samey-ness irrelevance, theirs is a persuasive point of view. Why not pair a silver sequin dress with a yellow windbreaker and a UFO-shaped straw visor? What’s stopping any of us? Or what about a pinup star’s leather swimsuit with a folk singer’s brown suede coat? A T-shirt with a ball skirt? Miuccia and Raf have given fashion oddballs oodles of ideas to riff on with this collection. “We do our human proposition,” Prada said.', 'Rather than tap into some exotic location or obscure film to inspire her new spring collection, designer Prisca Vera Franchetti went inwards. She leaned into her feels, pinpointing her emotions and memories around the dog days of summer, and then allowing them to inform the direction of her youthful, upbeat pieces. “I wanted to tap into all the different kinds of experiences of summer,” she said, choosing to make clothes appropriate for everything from chill beach days to dressy evening weddings, and all the plane rides in between (see: her cozy velour tracksuits, perfect for jet-setting).The assortment may have lacked cohesion, but perhaps that was the point—to offer a little something for everyone, depending on how they summer. It’s easy to fall into the tropes of the season (Dresses! Shorts! Swim!), but Franchetti zeroed in on her own summer nostalgia to give the pieces a more unique feel. The sleeveless, cotton-poplin tennis dress, for example, took cues from her childhood. “I don’t play tennis,” she said, laughing, “but I have memories of going to tennis class because all my cousins were doing it.” The slinky, olive oil-green two-piece shirt and trouser, or the countryscape-print jacquard dress or top with a corseted bodice, nodded to the relaxed fashions she used to see growing up in Italy. “My grandmother had a place in Sardinia,” she said, recalling the chic, easy fashions she used to see people don there. (Her daisy-print swimwear also begged for an Italian getaway.)Although Priscavera is built on young, fun party staples, it wasn’t all sweet and sentimental offerings—there were also saucy garments suitable for a perfect summer night out. The branded white tank tops were inspired by the touristy shot glasses or logo tees the designer came across in tacky Miami gift shops. Sparkly ribbed knits and metallic denim shorts were the kind of clothes you’d wear on a roaring night out complete with a hangover the next day. The long, floral-sequined slip dress also evoked the feeling of cascading water—Fun! Playful fashion is what Franchetti excels at, after all, and the designer said it best: “Dress for the types of summer you crave.”', 'It was Private Policy’s most normal collection yet. Like TikTok, this season designers Siying Qu and Haoran Li were obsessed with the office-siren trend—repopularized for this generation by clips of Gisele Bündchen in the movie The Devil Wears Prada—and decided to create fashionable office looks that were also hot and trendy.The designers are known for their experimental designs and themes. Their harness detailing is the most identifiable part of the brand, and they are known for being a favorite of the party crowd. So it was surprising to see that instead of harnesses and cutouts, we got a fairly standard collection with some great essentials. Some standouts included the vegan leather coats that came in deep burgundy and classic black. They were paired with jeans and button-ups, making for an excellent uniform for those who work in a less corporate but still professional environment. Tote bags are a massive part of work culture, and while the fictional characters in The Devil Wears Prada wouldn’t be caught dead with a boat tote near them, in real life it’s the bag of choice among 9-to-5’ers. Private Policy gave it an elevated treatment, making the bags in cargo green and khaki brown. The bag’s many front pockets make it easy to store all the essentials, from your ID to extra pocket change.But the fun wasn’t gone from Private Policy’s collection. A sparkly long-sleeve top worn under a work-appropriate cropped blazer and capri set would enable you to go from the office straight to happy hour, and button-ups for women featured a corset-like detailing that cropped at the sides to accentuate the hips. When asked if she thought this collection would deter the brand’s celebrity clients, Qu responded, “The relationship with our clients is like a relationship between others and their boss. We have to try to balance what they want but also what we want to strive for.” This collection might have lacked the sequins and fun from past outings, but Qu and Li promised that when you look close, you’ll see a rebellious edge to the silhouettes, plus distressing and hardware that might not be obvious at first glance.', 'Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez preempted the official start of New York Fashion Week by 48 hours with a small show for 140 people. The cycle is spinning into motion again, and, in pole position, the Proenza Schouler designers assumed some responsibility for setting the season’s tone. At a preview, they seemed primed and ready.“We really stripped things back to the point where we felt like there wasn’t a lot more to strip beyond last season,” McCollough said. “This season, we’re rebuilding some of our codes from the past in new ways.”Fashion has confronted a summer of challenges, from the wobbly wholesale system to sales declines to big hires not producing commensurate results. McCollough and Hernandez have clocked the prevailing mood. “No one needs another black suit,” Hernandez said. “What’s luring people, at least for us, is an emotional quality—like you look at that and you say, ‘that’s so amazing, I need it.’ It’s about trying to elicit an emotional response.”This morning their Tribeca loft venue glowed with amber September light and a spirit of reunion, and on the runway the clothes looked refreshed. Scarf-like square shapes formed the foundation of the collection. They said they were thinking of sails, though they hoped that the nautical theme didn’t read too literally. The squares were draped across the body, which meant you saw flashes of skin on sleeveless striped tops worn with button-front sailor pants, as well as on fluid floral print dresses with an appealing sense of motion. Knit dresses and top-and-skirt sets in graphic marinière stripes looked especially distinctive; they could be contenders for the kind of collector’s status their velvet tie-dye dresses from half-a-decade ago still enjoy.Asked to identify their codes, Hernandez and McCollough mentioned pleats and fringe, and both treatments were in ample supply. The former gave long jersey dresses in ivory, black, red, and lilac a classical Grecian quality, while the latter, constructed from both leather and tubes of organza, had more of a punkish, modern edge, especially the when they turned up on skirts with uneven, slashed hems.Rubber rain shoes and boots made in collaboration with Sorel and low-profile sneakers with subtle PS logos grounded many of the looks, giving them a street-ready attitude resonant of their New York stomping grounds. On that note, a pair of sail-back short shirtdresses are likely to find a lot of takers, too.', 'The last Puppets and Puppets was tinged with bittersweetness long before it bowed. About a week before, Carly Mark—then hailed as one of New York Fashion Week’s brightest young things—had announced that it was not only to be her last in the city, but also her last ready-to-wear proposal, with the brand decamping to London to focus on its more profitable accessories business. That melancholy lingered after it was over: while it was spiriting to see a designer make such a tough decision on their own terms (a rare case), it was widely agreed that this swansong collection was her most accomplished to date.Six months on, walking into the stately halls of London’s Institute of Contemporary Art, attendees at Puppets and Puppets’s big London debut were both overjoyed and a little perplexed to see not one, but 17 full ready-to-wear looks, with models ambling through a space delineated by a snaking black velvet rope.This being a Puppets and Puppets show, there was a quirk to factor in. While the clothes were indeed ready-to-wear, you wouldn’t need to wait the typical six months to get your hands on them. In fact, if you strolled about 10 minutes from the show venue to the nearest branches of Zara or H&M you’d be able to find a good deal of it on the racks—boxy T-shirts, navy crewneck sweaters, skinny black jeans, plain lingerie sets, faux-fur trimmed hoodies and fedoras aplenty. A handful of white polos were screenprinted with a new Puppets and Puppets logo—an upside-down lion and double-P insignia, designed by Brent David Freaney, the artist and art director behind the visuals Charli XCX’s now-canonized album Brat.Was Mark’s intention here an elaborate trolling exercise? Not quite. Rather than think of a fashion presentation solely as a forum for presenting new designs, she sought to evaluate its merit as a conceptual and artistic medium. In fairness, this logic is embedded in the brand’s origin story. “I was a fine artist from 18 to 30, and when I started Puppets and Puppets, frankly, I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t know how to sew or make anything,” Carly explained at the presentation “I’ve always been interested in fashion, but when it comes to making clothes myself, I’ve never felt that good about it. I’m more interested in fashion as a concept, and I’m interested in evolving the concept of fashion.”', 'Stepping into Chris Leba’s R13 showroom in SoHo was the sensory equivalent of walking past a flower shop in the middle of Midtown Manhattan—a splash of color and a whiff of freshness, somewhat unexpected but certainly appreciated.“The trick is to find how to do color and still look like R13, that’s my whole thing,” said Leba. And how exactly did he do it? “If you’re wearing something that’s sort of sweet, then you need to find some edge to add to it,” he said. Seems simple enough, but it was really Leba’s perennially cool touch that took this idea from theory to practice seamlessly.Take a primary red sequin jacket or a pair of pink floral cargos. Or a powder blue canvas jacket or sweet pair of flowery bloomers. None of these sound like R13, nor do they sound remotely cool. Trendy? Sure! Punk? Not quite. Except that here, Leba made his sequin blazer oversized and razor sharp, and rolled up its sleeves and paired it with a tiny pair of bloomers (yes, they’re a thing this season already) in a gray Prince of Wales check suiting fabric. The floral cargos were cut to hang off the body with a looseness that gave them a defiant, louche touch, and the canvas jacket was cropped just far enough up the abdomen that, when styled with a matching studded belt hanging off some Bermuda shorts, it evoked a sort of late ’80s kind of grunginess. As for those cutesy blossoming bloomers, they were worn with a belt almost as wide as the shorts themselves and a black leather T-shirt, which says it all.Across the board, Leba loosened up his proportions even more than usual this season, to positive effect. Particularly fresh was the way he dropped the crotches of his shorts and trousers, sometimes adding gussets in the same place to create even more space between the clothes and the body. There was an androgyny to these styles that carried a certain sultriness: “I want it to be sexy but not necessarily revealing,” Leba said. Mission accomplished.', 'The models at Rabanne wore pumps encased in plastic, like see-through galoshes to protect their pretty shoes from the elements. They would’ve come in handy in the steady rain that fell most of the day here in Paris.Like last season, Julien Dossena applied his prodigious skills as a designer to building out an everyday Rabanne wardrobe here. Though the word everyday doesn’t really do justice to the assemblages of garments in these looks, which consisted of a jacket (or sometimes two) layered over a half-buttoned shirt, a tee, and boxer shorts or a mini, with proportions he compared, quite aptly, to “a box with legs.”But he didn’t tame his instinct for the exquisite either. Some of those not-so-basic basics were finished in silver foil, and a blazer’s lapels were embroidered all over with tiny silver discs. The foiling technique gave romantic lingerie pieces a space-agey vibe aligned with founder Paco Rabanne’s 1960s vision, while a sparkly embroidered top of geometric panels linked by metal chains and worn with beaded basketball shorts couldn’t look more now.Most special were a trio of bags iterating on a Rabanne-made bag from 1969 in novel contemporary materials, one in Astier de Villatte’s fired white ceramic, another in blown glass from Murano’s Venini, and a third from coins of 18-karat gold by metalworker Arthus Bertrand officially dubbed the world’s most expensive bag. Each was accompanied by a matching minidress, the gold version trailing floaty bits of gold leaf in its wake. That one isn’t likely to make it to the sales floor, but that’s alright with Dossena; the iterative nature of the process is what he dug into this season. “That’s what I love,” he said, “to experiment all the time, to explore the materials, and to try to push the boundaries, because that’s what the house is about.”', 'Rachel Comey is of the only-do-shows-when-there’s-something-new-to-promote mindset. Last September it was her collaboration with the octogenarian artist Joan Jonas on the eve of her MoMA retrospective. This September it’s her new  made-in-Italy handbag collection. Comey’s done bags for years, but never in Italy. She’s leveling up.“I was intimidated by working with these Italian factories because of the cost of development and [the work of] running the business. So it had to be the right partners,” Comey said. “I’m trying to ‘work smarter, not harder.’ Someone said that to me a month ago, and I’m keeping it in mind.” It’s hard to believe Comey is intimidated by much. Twenty-odd years in, she’s built a business not with advertising campaigns or magazine editorials, but with the support of stylish customers for whom her clothes are part of their real lives.I think of what she does as norm-core for women who don’t do norm-core. There’s usually something a bit off, a bit quirky, about a Comey design, but it doesn’t get in the way of it becoming part of an everyday wardrobe. She may put these clothes on a runway, and hire a musical act to perform—this season Mexico City’s excellent Mabe Fratti—but she designs the clothes for the street.Comey said the spacious tool-bag tote the first model carried was designed with her clients in mind; “they’re women who work.” The clothes targeted all aspects of their lives. There was denim tailored into non-standard shapes like slouchy tunics and swaggy full-legged trousers, and suit jackets paired with fluid skirts in midi and ankle-lengths. The latter was a quite covered-up, even modest proposition. For contrast, she also had a yellow silk floral jacquard jumpsuit with a black lace racer back. Whimsy was part of the story too. A little black shift dress was embroidered with swags of gold fringe and colorful hand-knits that looked like your grandma might have made them—if your grandma liked Patrick Nagel in the ’80s.', 'As one of the well-established, traditional fashion brands, Rag & Bone needs to take steps to set itself apart from others. The label’s core DNA remains unchanged—it will still produce great quality sweaters, jeans, and jackets—but it’s seeking to innovate through subtle details.This season, classic knit cardigans coming in neutrals had mismatched mother-of-pearl buttons, adding a touch of that preppy aesthetic R&B has been leaning toward the past few seasons. The denim remained the same for the most part, and the designers continued to explore Miramar and Featherweight technology to get ultra-comfortable denim-looking pieces without actually having to wear jeans. To riff on that, this season Jennie McCormick decided to create a Miramar pair of jeans to mimic track pants but with that elevated touch. We’ve seen traditional track pants take over street style thanks to their comfort, but now you can buy a pair from Rag & Bone that feels more luxurious without giving up the comfort or aesthetic.Standouts in the look book included denim-looking tops made of mesh fabric. When paired with some jeans, the look is Canadian tuxedo, but the top is ultra breezy and lightweight. Elsewhere, bomber jackets got the eveningwear treatment. This season Rag & Bone’s classic coat came in leather with subtle embroidery detailing that paired well with daytime and nighttime pieces.', 'Rahul Mishra’s AFEW spring collection draws inspiration from Indian girls in rural villages, pursuing their dreams by moving to big cities. While embracing Western culture and being adept in Instagram and social media language, they remain deeply connected to their traditions. They style modern fashion with traditional Indian pieces and accessories, such as the long scarf known as a dupatta, the bindu or third eye dot painted on their forehead, and the stacks of delicate golden bangles adorning their wrists.“It’s a global approach,” Mishra explained at a showroom appointment in Paris. He envisioned a girl who is “a bit vulnerable, somewhat brave, and curious about the modern world,” yet remains deeply connected to and appreciative of her cultural roots. Mishra noted that local traditions and customs are increasingly being absorbed and diluted into a globalized culture, which “makes everything appear homogeneous”—a perspective that’s hard to dispute. Cue his ‘easy-to-wear’ collection, blending international appeal with Indian styling references.The traditional kurta—an elongated T-shaped tunic often paired with fitted pants—served as the foundation for crisp white cotton shirtdresses, adorned with tone-on-tone embroidery at the hem. Pleated skirts worn over leggings drew inspiration from Jaipur’s multi-paneled kurtas, reimagined in bold floral prints. Floral motifs and irises were also embroidered in sequins on pretty sundresses and masculine shirts, using patchwork techniques similar to those rural Indian women use to personalize their kurtas. “There’s strength in preserving your culture; wealth isn’t just about money,” Mishra remarked. “It’s about culture, upbringing, and family values.”', 'Ralph Lauren, at 84, does nothing by half measures. For his spring 2025 show, he invited guests out to a 19-acre horse farm in Bridgehampton, an afternoon’s journey from New York City, parked his vintage cars near the stables, including a 1970s red Ferrari with Colorado plates, and had show horses jumping in a training ring, while Usher, Jude Law, Naomi Watts, Tom Hiddleston, Colman Domingo, and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden looked on.If you were at Lauren’s 50th anniversary show in Central Park in 2018, this one had some of that flavor, with clothes from his eponymous collection, Purple Label, and Polo modeled by a multigenerational cast that ranged from Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell to adorable smiling kids taking their first tentative steps down a runway. In the years since that milestone show, the U.S. fashion industry has been rocked by the pandemic and its economic ripple effects. Lauren, our elder statesman, is a beacon in this challenging environment, his success a model for the generations of designers that have come up after him, and his clothes synonymous with all-American style the world over.As befit the Hamptons setting, the clothes he sent out tonight tapped a beachy, breezy vein in his work. The de rigueur American flag sweater was paired with short-shorts made in white crochet, a texture he also liked for a long slinky dress with a plunging v-front. Point being, there was something for any and every East End occasion, whether calico and lace for a poolside barbecue, or a midnight blue slip dress for her and an ivory linen dinner jacket for him to wear at a black tie fundraiser. He also made room for some western suede and leather fringe—we were in horse country, after all.Before the show, David Lauren walked editors around the vintage cars, pointing out how both the exteriors and interiors had been customized down to the tiniest details, according to his father’s exacting specifications. There’s a parallel there with the way Lauren finesses the styling of his shows. The clothes themselves are classics, just how he likes them; the real pleasure for him is in the mix: a humble white cotton tank with a jewel fringed long column skirt accessorized by a western belt; a marinière stripe, shirting stripe, and pinstripe ensemble; the tailcoat and holey jeans modeled by Turlington.When it was all over, Lauren emerged for a bow in a Team USA Closing Ceremony jacket (you’ll recognize it from the Summer Games in Paris). Behind him was a temporary Polo Bar that had been erected over the course of five weeks, twice the size of the New York City original. Absolutely nothing by half measures.', 'Raquel Allegra is saying YES to the dress… and everything else. “The idea of the collection is that feeling of ‘yes’,” she shared on a recent Zoom. “Your body’s cellular response to the word ‘yes,’ and the power that I believe carries internally and externally as you live your life saying yes to your heart, to your desire, and to your truth.”Her tightly edited spring lineup had her characteristic ease, but in a more pared back way. “We’ve made the collection smaller than ever before; it’s 20 styles and that’s it,” she explained. “When you’ve made a commitment to keep those 20 styles very meaningful, it makes it a little more challenging to take risks. So we’ve taken some risks in some calculated ways, but it is a more quiet collection.” A black linen suit was actually an all-over print that Allegra and her team had designed to make the fabric look “degraded like it had been in the sun.” Further adding to the illusion of something well worn were its raw hems, and stitched details that made it look like it had already been mended. Another trompe l’oeil-like effect was used on a pair of slim trousers gathered at the hem that appeared to be shibori-dyed. “It’s pretty impossible to actually make a garment like that in silk with proper indigo and have it look like that and stay like that over time because of the nature of the indigo,” she explained. Her cashmere sweaters came hand-embroidered with naive hearts and the word ‘yes.’ “You have your heart on your sleeve; the idea is to say yes to your heart.”', 'The dark, hard-edged mood Rave Review designers Livia Schück and Josephine Bergqvist were in last season has dissipated. Spring found them yearning to connect to nature and native crafts. The duo conjured the rustic Swedish country vibe they were after by working homey ginghams in different weights. They also transformed home textiles, including embroidered and often handwoven dishcloths, into tops and skirts. A nice flex was rendering the red check so common to such materials in embroidery. Puma sneakers were customized with thrift finds, and little friends hanging from waists were “scrap dolls.” The making of these friends from whatever is at hand is a Swedish kindergarten tradition, explained Berqvist. Now all grown up, the designers have adapted this make-do practice to creating clothes for flesh-and-blood women. Found materials remain a cornerstone, but the team plans to work more with deadstock to be able to scale.Rave Review’s take on the tank top was a pieced dress constructed using a sophisticated jigsaw panel. Pointed hems and asymmetries are always present in the brand’s collections; the gently draped hems of skirts made of swaths of different materials had movement, a recurrent theme this season. Shirts were hooded, as was a smart, tailored double-breasted coat that mixed glen plaids. All of this to say there was newness and relevance to the collection, but it felt like you really had to dig to find it. A feeling of déjà vu set in from the first look, a new-last-season sheer skirt. This is not to say carryovers aren’t a good thing, but at Rave Review, textiles change at a dramatically faster pace than the silhouettes, which seemed overly familiar; the result was that the show felt repetitive. Perhaps another format, maybe one as untraditional as the brand’s practice, would better serve the designers, who deserve praise for finding a new way to exist within a system that needs talents willing to lead the charge for change.', 'The internet may have declared the ribbon to be out, but according to designer Reem Acra, there’s nothing more classic. Acra, after all, is a timeless designer: while trends come and go, there will always be a market for classic evening wear in beautiful colors, adorned with sequins galore.But even though Acra prefers the classics, she stepped out of her comfort zone this season. She usually sticks to ultra maxi lengths, but this season she explored midi styles, grazing just above the ankle line so that your shoes could also have a moment to shine. That said, Acra will be sporting these midi looks with flats rather than a sparkly pair of heels. Ribbons adorned every look in the collection in some way, shape, or another, from being the star of the show on strapless gowns to subtly detailing shoulder straps.While Acra may have explored newer styles, some things are better left untouched. Her strapless chiffon pieces, popularized into the mainstream since Taylor Swift’s first Speak Now album, remain the same, just in sorbet colors to match Acra’s current aesthetic.', 'Early this month, as Paris Fashion Week was winding down, Cynthia Merhej transformed her apartment into a showroom and put as brave a face as possible on a situation that already was challenging and only has gotten worse since. “When things are bad, it’s good to have something to throw yourself into,” said the Beirut-based designer. “We’re very grateful to have distraction from the reality of things, and fashion is a great distraction.”By the same token, fashion has always been a formidable vehicle for resistance. A year ago, as war broke out in Gaza in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel, Merhej said she sought to counter anxiety and depression by designing clothes that would be light and liberating. Parachute material, sourced from an Italian mill specializing in technical fabrics, offered timely inspiration. As she manipulated it, the designer realized that the material could resemble flowers, poppies in particular. The work of Robert Mapplethorpe attracted her, and from there down a rabbit hole she went, discovering along the way that the flower was a popular symbol of Palestinian resistance in the 1970s and ’80s.For spring, the twin ideas of poppies and parachutes resulted in some charming pieces that somehow managed to blend military references and nostalgia-tinged romance. A pointillist camouflage, for example, here appears as an asymmetrical cascade of a denim skirt or as an ample top with an origami-like flower detail. A new iteration of a house signature, a fitted dark green jacket with barrel sleeves, and a couple of shirred off-the-shoulder tops looked simple yet special. So did some poppy-hued numbers in varying degrees of sheer, for example a parachute skirt trailing harness details or a shirtdress with a tulle overskirt embroidered with droopy blooms.\\nA short draped white dress with a low-slung black cummerbund resembled a deflated variation on the Limi dress that Chloé Sévigny chose for a red carpet appearance last summer, which doubled as a pre-release nod to the costumes Merhej produced for\\nthe actress’s latest film, Bonjour Tristesse.Considering the global context and the size of the Renaissance Renaissance team—Merhej, her mother, a seamstress, and goodwill from all over—spring also offers up an object lesson in agility and resilience. “For me, success is less a financial question than one of doing right by the environment, making sure the people on the team are happy, and making interesting, creative products,” the designer said. By that measure alone, this outing was a win.', 'Rentrayage’s Erin Beatty is experiencing a bit of a professional existential crisis. “I’ve found that my interest in fashion…doesn’t exist,” she said on a Zoom from her home in Connecticut. “The idea of fashion in this time and this moment feels so self-aggrandizing, and I’ve really had to sit with it because that’s what I’ve spent my life [doing]. So I had to ask myself, What am I interested in? What do I care about?” She discovered she still cared about clothing and getting dressed, but specifically, she cared about the clothes women wear and choose to wear.It makes sense that her interests lie in denim, which people, in general, tend to feel close connections with and which is meant to be worn as many times as possible, with the reward that it gets better with wear. As a kind of palate cleanser, Beatty started the season with cream-colored denim, which she used on a jacket with darts at the waist that made it more fitted and added a bit of flair. She also used the fabric on a wonderful A-line circle skirt and a new style of trousers inspired by a workwear pant with a high waist and a clean flat front. A ’90s-style maxi denim skirt made by cutting open the legs on a pair of jeans (you know the one) was updated by turning the usual triangular inset into a curved one that followed the lines of the body.Elsewhere her signature collage style shone: a vintage graphic T-shirt with the graphic covered by a variety of crochet doilies; a half-zip sweatshirt with an unorthodox floral fabric inset; and another with princess seams for a close fit and contrasting balloon sleeves. A polka-dot slip dress (“polka dots never expire,” Beatty said during our preview) had a pretty lace trim at the V-neck and side seams: It would likely go on to live a long life in someone’s wardrobe.', 'In a way, the 1930s ballroom at the Dorchester Hotel stands for every traditional ballroom in every super-luxury hotel in every city: venues for happy family celebrations, weddings, receptions, anniversaries, award ceremonies, what-have-you the world over. It was the perfect place for Richard Quinn to make his point about how his business has grown—quite hugely—to embrace women who come in need of formal, outrageously glamorous dresses.“The collection was really about the art of event dressing,” he said, “but also associating memory with clothes. So this was really about creating clothes that people will cherish over time. Being entrusted to make people’s wedding dresses is an amazing thing for me, for us.”The grandeur of the preshow scene was an event in itself—a party packed with Quinn’s international clientele, all a-sparkle in their poufs and ruffles and oversized flower prints. Quinn, always the host with the very most of London fashion, can never do things by halves: Before he dressed the show, he dressed the ballroom. An intense bank of white hydrangeas and orchids by Philip Hammond flanked the runway. Chandeliers glittered against the black-draped room. And behind the audience was positioned the English Chamber Orchestra and Choir, ready to perform soaringly emotional classical adaptations of songs with a personal meaning for the designer.Summer seasons are about weddings, of course. What the haute couture has always done in Paris, Quinn is now also doing from his headquarters in Bermondsey, South London. “This is about crafted dresses, everything is made by us in London. We’re in London, but we look to the world,” he said.The cult of Quinn has spread by word of mouth at wedding parties in Middle Eastern countries in particular. The spectacular beading he applies is designed at his studio and embroidered in India (as all European and American luxury houses do). He showed 10 bridal dresses in long silhouettes, with at least five short white ones for choice. Bevies of bridesmaids could be imagined, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers of brides.His repertoire of silhouettes is more or less the same as what it was when he was a Central Saint Martins student obsessed with the golden years of mid-20th-century couture. No one could have guessed back then that Richard Quinn, a working-class boy, was dreaming so big: to set up a house of his own, let alone do it. It means that Quinn is offering a shape for everyone to suit herself—a way to stand out within the guardrails of socially accepted formality.And to judge from the laughter and cheers of the clients who surrounded him backstage, he’s a designer who makes the whole process a lot of fun. And that’s an important ingredient too.', 'There were texts flying back and forth all over town. Is Rick really outside? It’s been a gloomy Paris Fashion Week, and it didn’t look like the rain would let up as showtime approached. In September, Rick Owens’s shows are usually held outside, staged on the monumental and highly cinematic terrace of the Palais de Tokyo. But then, by some stroke of luck, or maybe it was the tiny Ganesh figurine placed under the bench in Row B to ward off the clouds, the sun finally broke through. It was as if Cecil B. DeMille or Ken Russell, two of the movie directors Owens often quotes, were calling the shots from somewhere off-set.The gothy elegance and high camp of Owens’s sui generis aesthetic was built on the sweeping epics of old Hollywood, as he reminded this reporter backstage when the rain was still pelting down. The crumbling grandeur of the setting, the evocative hair and makeup by Duffy and Daniel Sallstrom, the otherworldliness of his models, the extremity of his clothes—when everything comes together it can leave the audience in raptures.This season, Owens changed the script. Instead of his usual cast of strange beauties, he invited students from Paris design schools to model. The motivation, he explained, was the unintended exclusivity of the show he held inside his Left Bank home last season. “My answer to that was, okay, we’ll invite everybody, and they can all be in the show,” he said. Students, unlike professional models who tend to the ever-more ectomorphic side of things, come in all shapes and sizes. “And the advantage, the plus side, of that is we get all of these body types to think about, and this is a great exercise for our company,” Owens said. “How do we make good stuff that fits all of these people? It’s so easy to do one size of everything.”The student cast made for the most diverse runway of the week (Paris, like the other fashion capitals, is backsliding on this issue). It was also the most inclusive of Owens’s career, and in that spirit well-aligned with the origin story he tells about leaving small-town rural California to join the “weirdos and freaks” of Hollywood Boulevard.Owens’s long narrow skirts with fishtail hems—their silhouettes lifted from old Hollywood movies of the ’30s—can sometimes be challenging, even for models who walk runways for a living. Throw in rain-slicked marble and some of the students struggled around the Palais de Tokyo’s vast spaces. It’s hard to witness that kind of discomfort, and it compromised the come-one, come-all message of the show somewhat.', 'Please welcome to the stage… Rio. Not Rio Sport, not Rio Uribe, and certainly not Gypsy Sport.Last we caught up with Uribe, in September, his label was called Gypsy Sport. Backstage he declared that show would be his last. Not for the label, but for the name, which had ceased to serve its purpose. Uribe then put an ask out for suggestions on social media, of which the most popular was Rio Sport. That didn’t work out—copyright issues, the usual—and so Uribe arrived at Rio, his first name.“I was fighting against it for a long time because I created Gypsy Sport to be a kind of anonymous collective brand,” said Uribe over the phone the night before his show. “It felt cool at the time, but I’m ready to own what I’m working on.”Uribe has been at it with his label for just over a decade now. But as exciting and directional as Gypsy Sport was, he admitted that business and scaling were not his focus. “I was being creative and doing what I wanted, but this time, with the amount of time and energy”—and resources, surely—“we’ve put into rebranding, I want to get better at having a business.” And so he has been working on strengthening his direct to consumer channel and hopes to get some wholesale accounts out of this show. He’s also launched a line of handbags, and is working on other category expansions.Making things that are more sellable was a priority here, as was an evident upgrade in materials and fabrications. “A little more grown up,” is how Uribe put it. An A-line maxi skirt with two drawstrings running vertically in the front will surely be a favorite of his customers, as will his fuzzy cropped knits, Bermuda shorts, and wrap skirts. Show-stealers were Uribe’s tailoring concoctions, which he said took him back to his time apprenticing for John Galliano, as were a white skirt with handkerchiefs hanging off its hem and a run of patchworked styles he made out of fabrics he’s been collecting from his visits to India, where his handbags are made. Uribe said he almost made an all-white collection to go with a rebirth theme, but he “got bored.” Good thing he did. Rio, the label, and Rio, the man, are far too interesting and, frankly, queer, to play into such tropes.This wasn’t a rebirth or a revival, and Uribe was hesitant to call it a level-up over the phone so as to not over-promise. But it was a confident step in the right direction. It was also simply fun, something Fashion Week could generally use more of.Around halfway through the show, one of the attendees was offered a whiff of poppers from a model: “I didn’t know I needed that,” they said afterwards, “but that was the best fucking thing that has ever happened to me at a fashion show.” As guests walked out, poppers or not, the vibe was definitely upbeat.', 'Roberto Cavalli “was the party,” as he reminded us tonight in a voiceover taped many years ago, so the first Cavalli show since his passing was never going to go off without one. Fausto Puglisi made sure of that when he enlisted Mariacarla Boscono, Alek Wek, Isabeli Fontana, Natasha Poly, Joan Smalls, Karen Elson, and Eva Herzigova to model the glamazonian dresses the late designer was famous for.Puglisi has been at Cavalli now for three-and-a-half years and he’s made it over in that time. While it’s still one of the louder brands in Milan, it’s subtler than it was in the house founder’s era. That’s down to Puglisi’s efforts to find the everyday in Cavalli. Those seven knockout event dresses will grab this season’s headlines, as they were intended to; Herzigova et al were channeling the old-school va-va-voom, after all. But the collection that preceded them struck a different note: beachy and chilled-out; sexy, but not trying too hard.Its starting point was Puglisi’s Sicilian hometown of Messina. The collection began with a series of white looks inspired by Messina’s houses, rope detailing evoking its seaside location. These were clothes to pack for holidays, with skin-baring cutouts, and short hems or high slits, often in pre-rumpled fabrics that won’t look worse-for-wear as temperatures rise. Puglisi spared a moment for neutrals, including a “fishing net” cover-up and faux snakeskin tailoring, designed for sight-seeing perhaps. Then he dove into photo prints of electric sunsets and crashing waves; they animated slip dresses and pajama sets all the way up to a goddess dress with a built-in capelet.The culmination of the collection was a trio of mermaid dresses that redeemed that oft-maligned red carpet silhouette—these were stretchy, where so many special occasion dresses are uptight and stiff. This might be Puglisi’s most important contribution to Cavalli’s sexy brand of dressing: ease and comfort are what make it modern.', \"In sifting through the archives at Rochas, Alessandro Vigilante came across photos of founder Marcel Rochas enjoying downtime at the beach. In stark contrast to today, the house’s founder dressed like a dandy even in OOO mode.Vigilante has been at Rochas for a year now, and with this presentation—a beachside cabana complete with sand, staged at the Théâtre de Châtelet—he seemed to be settling in a little more. Where prior outings channeled starlets of the silver screen lounging in a boudoir, here he nudged them into the real world, and in doing so gave the Rochas client a bit more to hang her hat on.Looking tan and hale himself, the designer described this collection as an homage to sea and sun. “A mid-century wardrobe with boyish tailoring and casual craft,” as he put it in the collection notes. During a walk-through, he also cited a print ad from 1949: A dark silhouette appears with a hat, bag, shoes, and jewelry, yet it’s not immediately clear what that woman is wearing.Vigilante has a few ideas to fill in the blanks: his mood board included images by Patrick Demarchelier as well as family photos of Marcel’s second wife, the Italian artist Rina Rosselli, in her bathing costume; and Marcel, ever in a suit, surrounded by family and friends.Shell shapes and on-point organic textures fleshed out the seaside theme. Borrowing directly from the founder's sartorial lexicon, Vigilante described a safari jacket as “beach wear that’s a bit boyish” yet he also managed to work in lightness and flou he qualified as “a little messy and easy to wear.” A few tulle tops picked up on the beach ball motif interspersed with an R logo. Shorts in sandcastle brocade gave the theme a literal spin, while cloud-like prints evoked nostalgia, and a sponge-based material, shown here in Look 17, brought both texture and sustainability to the mix.Vigilante described the Rochas woman as “a driven dreamer, but with feet on the ground.” This collection showed tentative progress: A coastal palette of coconut, yellow, navy and turquoise will be universally flattering, but as the house rolls into its 100th anniversary celebration next year—amazingly, Marcel was only 23 when he set up shop—it will need to ease up a bit on the past and focus on its future. No logo, however sleek, can prove a house’s relevance for the 21st century.\", 'There’s a heat wave sweeping Los Angeles right now, but that was not the inspiration for Rodarte’s spring collection—despite the presence of a big, bold sun in their lookbook images. “It’s an ode to California golden hour,” said Laura Mulleavy on a phone call. “Yes, it was all pretty organic; all the wildlife and the desert blooms. Things that really tend to have a huge influence on us texturally,” added Kate Mulleavy.Lace played a starring role in the collection; not only because the fabric made up many of the looks, but because it was the lace itself that guided their final silhouettes. “Usually we get fabrics and we spend so much time thinking about how to mold them into what we want to do,” said Kate. “A lot of the time it’s almost like trying to defy gravity, because you really want to use a fabric in a certain way and it pushes you into the outer limits in terms of what’s possible.” Laura continued, “We went through a couple of rounds of sketches for the laces because we were so inspired by it, and then we realized that you couldn’t just see what was beautiful about the lace itself. It’s nice to just look at what this fabric wants to be.” “We just had to let it all go,” added Kate.Dresses were clean, with barely any visible seams or darts. There was indeed a sense of covering a body with fabric and building a dress on the spot; like the white dress that opens the lookbook, with its simple off the shoulder construction and extra-long stand-alone lace sleeves; or the look that followed it, a straight-cut strapless black lace top worn with swooshy asymmetrical skirt. Another dress mixed a geometric lace pattern that alluded to traditionally Southwestern patterns with another lace that mimicked a floral lace skirt that appeared to be almost crochet. Its construction was slightly more complex than the previous dresses, but the focus remained on the lace.That same feeling was present in the metallic linen used on a pair of dresses with slight leg-o-mutton sleeves and little collars in sunset shades of pink and yellow; and another shrunken tailored jacket and mermaid skirt in gold. They were all transformed under the light, taking on the appearance of shiny PVC or molten metal. “We were really thinking about textures that could feel natural; it really reminded me of that glistening light,” added Laura.Within this interest in the natural, there was also an impulse to bring together unexpected textures for some of the collection’s best pieces—a black cotton eyelet dress embroidered with white sequins; or a delicate black silk embroidered dress punctuated by white crochet-esque cotton insets for a very bird-like result.“The starting point was lace and things like the metallic linen: it feels like there was a real organic quality to the work, things that are actually rooted in a kind of connectivity to nature, but at the same time they feel modern,” said Laura. Kate added, “I think a lot of times when we think about ‘modern,’ it’s always about how we’re going to dress in the future, like a kind of tech version of something. And I feel like this was the opposite in terms of inspiration, but the result was something very, very new.”', '“The inspiration stemmed entirely from the work done at our atelier’s table,” said Rok Hwang backstage. “It was about exploring the possibilities with fabric—how we could manipulate it, whether a strip or a thread, and seeing where it would lead us.” This season, rather than just deconstructing and assembling to achieve his typical volumetric, shape-shifting configurations, Hwang concentrated on craft and handmade processes. It gave the handsome collection a more romantic flair, lighter and softer, while keeping an inventive sartorial edge.Hwang said that his team found joy in experimenting with techniques and dyes, and that sense of levity played out throughout the collection. Delicate strips of recycled chiffon and leftover ribbons were meticulously crafted into handmade rosettes, dyed a soft pale hue with organic tea and arranged into a blooming, cocoon-like shape; they also adorned the slender jacket of a sharply tailored men’s black suit. Shirring and ruching added dimension to billowy blouse-capes in mousseline, layered over finely studded wide-leg denim, or shaped the gently curved half-moon panniers of an off-white corset paired with draped slouchy trousers. Whirls of cascading pleated ruffles, light shirred half-frocks arranged asymmetrically in an artful state of draped collapse, and short peplum crinolines bursting from tank tops conjured an edgy, romantic vibe. Despite all the poetry and whimsy, Hwang’s approach is actually rather realistic—his collaboration with H&M in April sold out in no time.', 'Roksanda Ilincic’s affinity with women artists backgrounds everything she does. It’s part of the emotion she stirs with her generous shapes and unerring eye as a colorist. A symbolic correlation between her spring collection and a work by the Hungarian environmental artist Agnes Denes wasn’t overstated at the beginning of the show. It was a wheat ear left on every chair.In 1982, Denes famously planted a wheat field in Lower Manhattan. The photograph of her standing in it, with the tower blocks of corporate America rearing up in the near distance, still has the power to shock. “The story (behind Denes’s work) is industrialization and people chasing money, Wall Street, everything happening, going one direction,” Ilincic said before the show. Denes’s work was titled Wheatfield—A Confrontation. “This was over 40 years ago, and we’re getting more and more removed from our own human values, ecology, the planet,” said the designer. “All of that resonated with me. And also that idea of big conglomerations against humanity is so relevant today, unfortunately.”Meanwhile, Ilincic’s guests arrived to inhale the wonder of her venue: the seventh floor of a cylindrical Brutalist office block with 360-degree views over London—a relic of a bygone corporate world. Against the tall windows of Space House, the clean vertical architecture of her tailoring made perfect sense. But Ilincic was planning more of a personal, indirect reflection on her shared Eastern European roots with Denes: her memory of the landscape of Belgrade, where the sight of wheat fields was commonplace in her Serbian upbringing.It didn’t feel like a confrontation, but when she shifted to showing her dresses—the core of her business, as her colorfully attired gathering of fans always attests—the blurred prints were taken from aerial photographs of the landscape around her hometown and she used wheat-y raffia and viscose fringes to sculptural effect. The melancholic import of Ilincic’s thoughts was only perceptible aurally in a recording of a Siân Phillips reading of Matthew Arnold’s “Dover Beach”—a poem that bleakly laments the state of the world but holds out fragile hope in the human ability to love.', 'Roland Mouret knows his customer well. Leafing through the rails of clothes in the bright, high-ceilinged studio space he shares with Self-Portrait’s Han Chong, it was hard not to be struck by their tactile, near-seductive desirability—especially for the kind of sleek urban woman (with a handful of events to attend every week) who is his client. “I think we’re starting to own our place in that market from eveningwear to ceremony [dressing],” Mouret said. “It’s not the kind of collection that will change dramatically every season, but it’s always evolving.”Of course, Mouret was being a little modest: He’s owned a hefty slice of that “place in the market” since he first launched his eponymous label back in 1998 and was rocketed to fame by the Galaxy dress shortly thereafter. But over the past two-and-a-bit years since the brand was acquired by Chong and had a soft reboot, Mouret has hit a new stride, effortlessly balancing his more directional instincts with a carefully attuned commercial nous. Just take the first look at his spring 2025 collection: a supremely elegant black column dress with a twist—quite literally—in the form of a trail of black-and-white double-sided crepe that curled with a sculptural flair across the shoulder and was left to trail behind for a striking vertical echo of the dress itself. Fashion-forward, but not fussy.While Mouret has found himself dabbling in the ’80s over the past few seasons, this time he went for some subtle decade hopping. Sure, there was a distinctly decadent ’80s flavor to the mini dresses with asymmetric, angular, and diamanté-studded panels placed over the chest, or the razor-sharp femme fatale glamour of a blazing red power-shouldered gown with an artful fold of fabric across the bust. But there was a softer, more romantic side on offer, too, through the palette of icy pale blues, pinks, and yellows, or the ravishing gowns made from bias-cut silk chiffon, with translucent capes sprouting from a kind of loose, crystal-covered choker at the neck, then billowing behind the wearer for an additional touch of drama. (Also see the origami-like, spiraling folds of fabric used to create flowers that sprouted from the bust lines like corsages.)Some of the most beautiful pieces were dresses made from transparent copper brown sequins overlaid on mesh to create a shimmering, translucent, almost mirage-like effect on the body. Mouret’s eyes seemed to twinkle as he looked at them, but he was quick to say these particular designs weren’t just flights of fancy: They were a continuation of a series of similar looks from his prefall collection that his clients and buyers had responded to with particular enthusiasm. What is it that makes Mouret’s clothes truly tick? Sure, he may know his customer well—but his endless curiosity as a designer means he always wants to get to know the customer better, season upon season. That’s why they keep coming back.', 'From the loft-like, second-floor space that served as designer Romeo Hunte’s backstage this year, a description of his spring 2025 collection came quickly: If Netflix were to produce a teen drama following the lives of artsy, big city high school kids, and said kids were allowed to remix and restyle their dress codes of khaki pants, polo shirts, and button-downs, this is what they would come up with. It wasn’t too far off.“It’s very Brooklyn, cool, early-’90s kid, with a twist,” Hunte said. “Bright colors, stripes, polos—but the polos are upside down.” A Brooklyn native who still lives in the borough, Hunte regularly bumps into Spike Lee near the director’s 40 Acres and a Mule office and studio space. In recent months, as he worked on the spring collection, the designer found himself reminiscing about Lee’s seminal coming-of-age film, Crooklyn, set in Bed-Stuy.What stood out from the offering backstage—and what felt most in line with Hunte’s youthful, Brooklyn inspiration—were multiple versions of his sagged pant design (one, a combination of a chino and a camo army pant, another khakis underneath sweats); a sleeveless silk top with a quarter water print; and those upside polos, which went down the runway in both shirt and dress variations.The show started with an illustration of a brownstone-lined Brooklyn block projected onto the walls of the small Midtown space. The aforementioned pieces, worn on a diverse group of models, made sense against the backdrop (as did the cutoff shorts with exposed pockets, which made this writer nostalgic). A few looks, however, seemed amiss—namely those that were pantless. A denim blazer paired with matching briefs, and a white button-down styled with nothing but a necktie didn’t scream Brooklyn; they’re not the type of outfits you want to wear on the A train. A khaki trench dripping in crystal fringe didn’t seem all that practical either, but it was delightful to look at and seemingly fun to wear, which is sometimes all that matters.', 'For spring, Rosetta Getty was thinking pragmatically about the things she loves to wear and the way she loves to wear them, and as such, her collection was injected with a real sense of ease. She brought back a favorite caftan from last summer, in a beautiful striped brown fabric and with matching pants, so she could continue wearing the style once the weather cools down. She also reintroduced a shirtdress with a wrap-skirt bottom from her very first collection, this time in a blue and orange plaid, and paired it with the very same striped pants. It had a ’90s, youthful kind of vibe. “I love all the different stripes and the plaids together; it’s like they actually go together, but they don’t,” she said at a recent appointment in her Tribeca showroom. In fact, Getty was really animated by things that “didn’t match,” she said, like mixing turquoise and baby blue and butter yellow in one look, and her marled knit dresses and tops with contrasting stripes of solid black and white.\\xa0Instead of her usual granny-square crochet pieces, she wove a silver metallic yarn in her classic hand-crochet style and made a very elegant maxidress. “We could do this for evening,” she posited. “We’ve always done crochet, but we’ve never done it in such a simple way—in fact, it’s a little heavy.” It was indeed weighty, but that’s what made it into something evening appropriate. Elsewhere, it was the lightness of a cotton dress with a balloon hem and the thinnest, softest matching knit separates that stood out. “This season, I feel like everything worked,” Getty said. “Sometimes it feels like we have to do a lot to meet certain demands, but this time, I feel like we just did what we wanted and it worked, which is always great!”', 'All eyes on were on Steven Stokey-Daley today as he took his first step into womenswear—it was a light and confident one, illuminated by an aura of young London buzz from either side of the runway. On one side, there was Harry Styles—his minority investor and very early adopter—and on the other, Emma Corrin, who made their way in dressed in two pieces from the collection that was about to be shown. Their beaded abstract floral tank and black tailored Bermudas turned out to be a coda of kinds for Stokey-Daley’s inspiration—the life of the British painter Gluck, who presented as a man in the 1920s and ’30s, and Constance Spry, the hugely fashionable high society florist, who was one of her many lovers.Quick note here to say it didn’t read as the least bit historically labored. It was a flowy, contemporary combination of Stokey-Daley’s English handcrafty talent, his tailoring, and wafty things—including the clever addition of a silk floral side-ripple to his signature Oxford bags.But to backtrack a bit. Four years have been a lot in the life of Steven Stokey-Daley. “Phew, this has been a whirlwind since beginning,” he exclaimed before the show, and he was not exaggerating. His story is not much short of pandemic fashion miracle: In 2020, the designer was but a recent Westminster University graduate, Instagramming his final collection—all Oxford bags and romantic shirts upcycled from deadstock materials and charity shop finds—while locked down in his home in Liverpool.Double-Harry magic happened for Stokey-Daley when Harry Lambert, Harry Styles’s stylist, contacted him, among all sorts of fashion-fanatical young men who were suddenly jumping into his DMs to order from their lockdown-situation bedrooms in America, Korea, and Europe. Famously, Styles sent Stokey-Daley’s looks—and the designer’s name—viral when he wore them in his “Golden” video in 2020.Post-pandemic, Stokey-Daley instantly lifted London’s spirits with his very British-subversive theater play on queering upper-class boys’ school uniform. His take on all of that is classic, funny, and refreshingly youthful all at the same time. Such delights as his adorable dachshund sweaters have only added to the daft English sense of fun around his brand—irresistible buys, gifts, whatever.Even funnier: These days you’re as likely to see actual English gents—say at the Chelsea Flower Show, or at a country house weekend—wearing S.S. Daley as a Harry Styles fan. This, of course, indicates that the label possesses a highly unusual, growing social bandwidth—something different from your normal young designer mini-niche.', 'Waiting for the Sacai show to start today, you got the distinct sense that it had graduated from an insider cult favorite to a global super brand, with a front row full of on-the-rise celebrities in Chitose Abe’s avant-garde designs. The longtime Sacai admirer in me felt a unique blend of territoriality and pride.Backstage Abe was reflecting on her 25 years in business. Reaching a milestone like that might put some in a valedictory mood—somebody’s always celebrating an anniversary somewhere—but Abe seemed more ambitious than ever, and I’m not talking about that influencer-heavy front row. “I wanted to create the familiar archetype into something completely new by going back to Sacai’s origin,” she said through her interpreter.While her collection was rooted in the classic wardrobe elements it often features—peacoats, marinière sweaters, trenches, army-surplus jackets—the pieces had a particularly French flavor, with flourishes lifted from couture. Abe said she’d “finally” opened a Paris office for Sacai, ”so maybe that’s reflected [in the clothes].”A seatmate said the gold SA embroidered monogram on a coat pocket reminded him of YSL. For me, it was the silky white shirt collars that gave the show its Parisian spirit. There were other elevating details, too, like the bustles embellishing a pair of boxy striped tees, the sheer panels inset into the shoulders and backs of chunky speckle knit sweaters, and the deep pile of multicolor fringe used for miniskirts and a chubby coat that evoked fur as well as or better than the faux stuff.The collection’s high point came at the end, with a trio of evening looks that put Abe’s pattern and cutting gifts on vivid display. Deconstructions of Le Smoking, they looked black tie appropriate but utterly unconventional, in true Sacai fashion.', 'When Anthony Vaccarello made his debut for Saint Laurent back in the fall of 2016, he showed at the house’s Left Bank headquarters at Rue de Bellechasse while they were being renovated. Essentially it was like being on the most glamorous building site ever, with a towering crane holding aloft an enormous neon version of the YSL logo in the night sky to remind you exactly where you were. (I mean, come on: Hallowed ground!)Flash forward eight years—Really? It has been that long? It feels like yesterday—and Vaccarello decided to show once again at Rue de Bellechasse. The only construction this time was the semi open air set of a golden oval elevated into the air, akin to a huge picture frame, under which we all sat. The runway, meanwhile, was painted a shade of deep cobalt-y blue which was only revealed when the light hit in a certain way. (Or the rain. Yikes, that inclement Parisian weather strikes again! Kudos to the models who still managed to navigate it with absolute grace and, it has to be said, steely determination.)Yet Vaccarello went back in another way too, specifically conjuring up Yves Saint Laurent himself, or more specifically, his personal style, right down to his weighty eyeglasses. It made for a truly exceptional collection, strong and compelling from beginning to end. Vaccarello showcased impeccable mannish tailoring in anthracite or black or plum of a distinctly Yves persuasion, with double breasted jackets and wide pants which were soft but so expertly cut they came without a hint of sloppy slouchiness.Vaccarello had been inspired, he said, by reading an interview from around 2000 with Saint Laurent when he’d been asked about who his woman was, and the designer had replied it was him. “After I read it, I thought, ‘OK, maybe that’s where I want to start,’” he said backstage. “My last men’s show in March had been all about tailoring, but based on flou; I wanted this one to be the opposite—more strict. It’s not about when I would do a tuxedo for a woman which was worn naked underneath. The suits come with shirts, ties. You’re dressed. It’s about control, and power, in a way.”Sometimes too a greatcoat or trench or voluminous leather aviator jacket was thrown over the looks—but regardless, everything came accessorized to the hilt, from the aforementioned eyewear and wide ties, to the jeweled shoes and the weighty gold bangles which gleamed from every wrist. It’s not the first time that Vaccarello has embraced the ‘done’ look that’s so much part of the YSL lexicon. Yet in a world where everything just seems to be getting ever more reductive and oversimplified, all fleeting image with nothing really behind it, Vaccarello’s counter-intuitive move to go against the grain was magical.', 'Spring was a swashbuckling affair at Salon 1884. Andrea Mary Marshall chose Giacomo Casanova, the 18th-century Venetian adventurer, as her starting point. Criminal as some of his behavior was, Casanova, who is best known for his seductions, continues to fascinate (yet another biography was published in 2022). It’s not difficult to see why Marshall would be drawn to this self-invented man who was able to adapt to seemingly any situation. “I really love creating a character,” said the artist and designer, who took the self-portraits that comprise the look book.Casanova recounted his adventures and journeys in a memoir called The Story of My Life; listening to Marshall explain her process and intentions—“I wanted this collection to feel like a love letter that felt like a heartbreak,” she said—it seems like she could pen an essay called “The Story of a Collection.” Marshall, who was already a successful artist when she launched Salon 1884, thought she could balance both areas of creativity, but she found that fashion took up all her time. “I felt I needed to bring my art practice back in [to Salon], and one thing that was holding me up was the patternmaking; I couldn’t really express myself the way I wanted to. I wasn’t in control of the silhouette, the proportion, where the darts go…I was always diluting [my ideas],” she said. To rectify the situation, she hired an FIT professor to teach her patternmaking and draping. “I worked like a maniac,” Marshall continued. “I didn’t sleep for six months, and I didn’t really need to because I was so involved.”Perhaps it was the romantic/decadent theme, but this collection had a distinctly dressed-up feeling. Among the fanciest pieces were a “cake” dress made of 150 yards of toffee-colored tulle and a Vionnet-y black gown with triangular inserts of black lace. Casanova wrote of a ménage à trois with two nuns, and the black and white typical of habits was used for a cheeky basque corseted dress with a full skirt, with a slit up one leg that revealed the hip-padding underneath, which Marshall styled with a white veil. The 18th century met the New Look in two coatdresses, one of snug black leather with hip flanges/pocket flaps, the other in caramel Loro Piana fabric with corset lacing at the princess seams to the waist and down the back, with panniered hips and a fuller skirt. Beautifully made, these pieces had a certain formality and historicism.', 'If the ’90s girls had Miu Miu, today’s generation have Sandy Liang. The designer who’s held the internet in a chokehold with the coquette-core trend for the past two years is now declaring that to be out, so instead next summer expect every girl in New York and beyond to dress like spies, except of course with the Liang touch. “I’m obsessed with a uniform. I’m especially obsessed with spy gear this season,” said the designer. “The spies in Totally Spies! always had gadgets and clothes that were cute but it was actually like a laser or something serious like that. I thought that was fun to explore for the season.”On the internet, Liang is known to best influence the crowd of ages 27 and younger. When her Baggu collaboration dropped, you not only saw the bag sell out within minutes thanks to its affordability, but those who missed it began to recreate her pieces so they could also look like the Liang girl on a budget. However, the brand’s best customers are not the high schoolers who wish to look like a Liang girl but the 9-5ers who can afford the pieces. The label’s collections in the past few seasons have skewed more childish, with school-inspired pleated skirts, but this season, the Liang girl is growing up and taking her first baby steps into the real world. She may have gotten her first corporate job and is dressing business casual on top with a short-sleeved puff blazer and capri set, but she’s also channeling her youth with a metallic pink kitten-heeled mule. She may not understand the importance of carrying cash (just in case of emergencies), so instead she’s leaving her house with no bag but a mini skirt with a hidden zippered pocket for only her driver’s license because her credit card is on her phone.Liang made things simple, utilizing a jersey fabrication for most of the collection. Going out mini dresses came in fun colors like Barbie pink and candy apple green but in basic silhouettes: When paired with the right accessory, like one of the new sequined chokers that debuted on the runway, the look was elevated from day to night (best represented by looks 14 and look 31 in the collection). A Liang collection is never complete without some satin, and this season some of the tunics worn as dresses during the show could double as coats when worn with the jeans also shown on the runway.In an intriguing statement, Liang ended her show notes with the line, “Each piece is password protected; only you can unlock it.” Even though Liang herself is dreaming of a spy girl summer; perhaps it was a subtle hint that you can feel free to create your own fantasies in her designs.', 'A run-down, 94-year-old brick warehouse by the Brooklyn Navy Yard isn’t the first place one might expect to find magic, but so it came to pass. The conjurers of this shimmering and fleeting enchantment were SC103’s Sophie Andes-Gascon and Claire McKinney, and the occasion was their spring 2025 show, held just blocks away from their first shared space, from which the 103 in the brand name came. The duo, who only show every two years or so, noted that it was the fifth anniversary of their runway debut, back in 2019, when they were barely formed as a company. “I don’t even think we had a bank account yet,” said Andes-Gascon with a smile. However, it was a more recent event—their two-week exhibition at Theta Gallery in Manhattan—that had the most impact on this collection.Visitors to that show, titled “Chimera” after the fantastical hybrid creature of mythology, would have recognized some of the garments that the models wore, as the designers’ alchemy was twice applied. As McKinney explained, a few of the artworks “were in shapes of garments, but oftentimes stuffed or flattened to outline a garment but not suggest the wearability of it, in a way. And then some of those pieces got retransformed back into garments for this collection.” This feels somehow like a parable of clothing in that it speaks to the way something flat is animated by the body, and more generally the transformative aspect of getting dressed, an activity that Andes-Gascon and McKinney believe should be uplifting.The shared inspirations for their art and fashion shows were, said the former, “flags and icons and sort of the celebratory banners, words, symbols…but also always in keeping with our themes of celebration and togetherness and parade.” The opening look consisted of appliquéd striped pants with something of a “big top” aspect to them, and a craft-crocheted tunic with red and purple feathers at the neckline and armholes and various trimmings, including fringe and buttons. This ensemble was followed by a multicolored crinkled organza dress with a V-neck and a slightly dropped-waist and tiered skirt. Andes-Gascon noted it was similar to those that had performed so well at the brand’s pop-ups. Look 5 was made of a scrubbed poplin painted by McKinney. The back of the dress featured, she said, “silk screens from original drawings that were done on paper for the show at Theta.”Reuse and repurposing are central to the SC103 ethos, as are costumey and vintage touches. Spring’s lineup, however, was notable for being tighter (more edited, closer to the body) than before. There was also, observed McKinney, “a freshness in this collection; it’s a little bit stripped down.” It was also rather wearable. Printed cotton was sewn into hybrid track-cargo pants and skirtlike shorts and deeply dropped crotches. Looks 20 and 30 were resurrected from art to garments. The former featured spangled and collaged wings that have, as is so often the case with SC103’s designs, a drawing-come-to-life quality. Unlike the witches in William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, who craft potions with ingredients like “eye of newt and toe of frog, wool of bat and tongue of dog,” Andes-Gascon and McKinney, who have more in common with Tinkerbell, cast wondrous spells with sequins, thread, paint, and ribbons. The crowd was spellbound.', 'It’s a good moment to be Daniel Roseberry. Fashion has decided to swap the bland sameness of quiet luxury and the banality of algorithms for a mood that’s more eccentric. And eccentric fashion is something Roseberry excels at, as he’s proven over and over again at his couture shows for Schiaparelli. Ready-to-wear is a newer project chez Schiap and he’s been tinkering with the formula the last few seasons, but even if he dialed down the surrealist touches that founder Elsa Schiaparelli was famous for and that he embraced with such gusto at the beginning of his tenure here, he’s definitely making fashion for extroverts.Consider Kendall Jenner’s blue jeans, whose waistband did a U-shaped dip in the front and back, further accentuating the nipped silhouette of her ivory jersey bodysuit with stretch corset inside. Not your basic five-pocket style denim. That hourglass shape was a recurring theme, whether on a zip-front denim day dress or a fancier halter dress in black compact jersey with off-white jersey draping below the hips.But Roseberry’s mission here was to hit a lot of different beats, so this wasn’t a collection about themes or trends; it was more like dipping into the idiosyncratic closet of a life-of-the-party type—one who wears zebra stripes, believes in the power of shoulder pads, and only wears florals if they’re embroidered with hand-painted sequins—and trying on all the highlights.At a preview, Roseberry made a point of saying how few embroideries he used this season. Instead, he created texture and surface interest in other ways: By gathering the blue mesh jersey of a bodycon dress into a series of knots which formed a long braid that the model held coiled in her hand like a whip. Or by stitching strips of suede to a knit dress then shellacking the ends for a touch of shine. “It’s all about taking that oomph that people love from the couture and making it just super-effortless,” he said. That rule also applied to the season’s new shoes. Roseberry has garnered a lot of attention for Schiap’s golden trompe l’oeil toe sneakers. Tweaking that idea, he added a golden toe ring to the trompe l’oeil toes of leather babouche slides—unconventional and fun.', 'Boscobel, a historic estate overlooking the Hudson, was the setting for Sea’s spring 2025 lookbook. One reason for choosing it, said designer Monica Paolini: “It’s close to where Sean [Monahan] and I grew up.” The team showed Upstate some sartorial love by embroidering horses and lambs on a soft gray cardigan styled with a long pleated hybrid skirt that was khaki (tan) and cargo (olive drab) on front and back, respectively. A pair of pants was similarly designed. Extending the country theme, there was an ochre-colored barn coat with brown corduroy collar and sweet Sea embroidered motifs, as well as a really smart rain cape with a snap on/off hood. Cargo pockets added a utilitarian/military air to unfussy, monochrome separates. The collection needed such gravitas to ground the effusion of eyelet and cut-out work. Those dresses, especially the white ones, looked best layered over pants. It wasn’t only cut-outs creating a sense of airiness, but lace as well, used on the skirt of a one-piece dress with a hooded button down top.Sea has found its land legs in the form of sports influence; for spring, there was a nylon zip-up jacket with crochet details. If the Chariots of Fire references Paolini mentioned were elusive, those to Marie of Romania, a 19th-century fashion plate were not. The designer was drawn to the way the royal mixed embroideries. Needlework inspired by Eastern European garments and home textiles added color to the collection. By now, this head-to-toe folksy look is expected, and a bit rote, at Sea. Yet an embroidered jacket with a pair of upcycled and mended denim jeans was a winning “a little bit country, a little bit rock ’n’ roll” combo.', 'Sebastien Amisial’s spring collection was inspired by winemaking. “Starting from cultivating the soil, planting the seed and the seed turning into a grapes, grapes turning, being pulled, pulverized, and then cured so they can turn into wine, and then that being aged beautifully so you can enjoy it or just hold onto it,” the designer described during a Zoom appointment the morning after his show. “That whole process is very synonymous to a lot of ideologies pertaining to our growth.”It was a reflection on how far Sebastien and his partner Marianne Amisial have come since they first started their label four years ago, when it was named a finalist in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, and they staged their first runway presentation during New York Fashion Week, but it was also present in the clothes themselves—especially in the color palette. A sporty zip-up jacket and a long pleated skirt in a burgundy faux leather made for a more casual take on the skirt suit, and was accessorized with a maroon sweater artfully tied around the shoulders. “The faux leather has this liquidy waxy context and it almost sticks to the body, which is really amazing,” Sebastien said. “We wanted to have a balance between real leather and faux-leather because there are just some things that leather can’t do.” The real leather pieces though, were some of the standouts of the collection. Made from Verona leather dyed black and then hand-distressed to a shade of mustardy-olive, they used it on a couple of wardrobe essentials; a pair of straight leg jeans, and a terrific slouchy hooded bomber jacket with fleece lining. More unexpected were the pieces in shades of green, taken from white grapes, like the double breasted jacket in seafoam green bouclé wool belted and worn as a dress, and an all-knit wool cashmere ensemble of slouchy “sweatpants,” a polo neck sweater, plus another sweater draped around the shoulders in a shade that one could call tea green, that added a freshness to the lineup.There was much to like in this collection—cropped denim jackets with rivet details, flocked denim pieces in a shade of deep mossy green that caught the light beautifully, swingy pleated shorts, and a great wrap shirt with lapels that’s sure to become their signature. Two versions were shown, one in white cotton worn as an overshirt with a mesh tank and khaki shorts that was summer incarnate; and another in denim, underneath a dark brown tweed overcoat and matching elastic waist trousers, that was dramatic and very sexy.', 'Han Chong is always plotting something. In the short space of just three months, the designer has—deep breath—released a 35-look resort collection; staged the most extravagant of his annual summer parties at the Roof Gardens in Kensington; opened a marble-and-steel flagship in the center of Bangkok; and welcomed Christopher Kane as Self-Portrait’s first designer-in-residence, (back in 2021, he also lifted Roland Mouret’s brand out of administration). Even despite the implosion of Matchesfashion—the British e-commerce giant once sold significant quantities of Self-Portait’s flirtatious cocktail pieces—business continues to bloom and boom.“We now have 70-something physical stores in different territories,” Chong said at a preview of his spring collection in his sprawling east London studio. “Which means I need to think of Self-Portrait as more of a lifestyle brand.” There’s only so many occasion dresses that one person needs, and so this season, the designer focused on building a versatile, daytime wardrobe to keep all those shop doors revolving. Cropped nylon windbreakers, drawstring canvas jackets, barrel-legged jeans, and button-down skirts in cream denim were about as practical as Self-Portrait gets. Elsewhere, knitted polo shirts, collared cardigans, and oversized woolen blazers bearing crystalline pinstripes looked office-appropriate until styled with sheer skirts and suede hot pants. Lace shifts were designed to be worn over sensible camisoles or holiday bikinis. “What do they call it?,” Chong said. “Cost-per-wear?”But glamour will always (always) trump pragmatism. The designer was at his most animated when speaking about the construction on a rhinestone mesh column with swooping back cut-outs. See also: the bias-cut silk dresses with floral appliqués and the bonded crepe minis that felt sturdier than the sum of their parts. “The Self-Portrait girl used to put more effort into going out, but she prefers to chill with her friends these days and so the collection is less serious as a result. It’s not over-done,” he added. Kane’s soon-to-be-released line of partywear twinkled from a distant rail. “I’m not sure who we’ll invite into the studio next,” Chong said. “Sabrina Carpenter? Imagine a Self-Portrait song of the summer.”', 'In a razzle-dazzle of lights, cameras, and nonstop party action, Christopher Kane’s Residency collection for Self-Portrait set off like a fireworks display in London last night. Blinging crystal, pastel frills, chain mail, teeny-tiny bodycon dresses: All the elements that fueled his explosive debut in spring 2007 were there. “Look! She’s like a Fabergé egg!” Kane laughed, admiring a model shimmering in a neck-to-thigh smothering of silvery rhinestone mesh. Strips of chain mail twinkled around her bodice. A crystal zipper tag swung at her neck. Frilled white lace ankle socks matched the ruffles circling her bodice and hips.The socks, this look, and 29 more went up on Self-Portrait’s website at 8 p.m. London time last night. It was just as the warehouse-size party-slash-shoot was getting started, news that had guests checking their phones and doing a double take at the prices. The aforementioned Fabergé dress: £650. The socks: £30. As much as it’s clearly a full-strength Christopher Kane throwback, there’s a lot going on that’s very different from the old days.“This was Han’s idea,” said Kane. “He said, ‘Let’s go for it!’” Han Chong is the owner of Self-Portrait, the mega-selling phenomenon he set up in London in 2013. Having quietly built up manufacturing facilities in China and stand-alone stores selling accessibly priced event, bridal, and children’s special-occasion wear around the globe, Chong has allowed himself the luxury of setting up his Residency project. “I didn’t want to do a transactional collaboration like others,” he said. Chong was circulating delightedly around the pre-drinks fashion-show chaos. “I just had a spontaneous feeling about Christopher’s work,” he shrugged. “He celebrates femininity, and that’s what Self-Portrait is always about. And the timing’s right—we’ve had enough quiet luxury!”Loud, fun, sexy dressing at prices to fit the budgets of teenagers and young women is now a reality on a level it couldn’t be in 2006, when Kane and his sister Tammy were laboriously hand-making every piece themselves. There aren’t any direct actual replicas from the first collection, he points out. Among the total looks are stretch-lace catsuits with scrunchie cutouts, glamorous satin bias-cut slip dresses, minis, midis, and maxis, frilled bags, and sweaters.“Han called me in the spring, after I’d posted photos of that collection when it was in the ‘Design Museum Rebel: 30 Years of London Fashion’ exhibition,” Kane said. “It reminded him. That exhibition jogged a lot of people’s memories. I’ve had a lot of celebrities asking to borrow from the archive since then.” (Full disclosure: I curated that exhibition, with four neon-bright bandage, crystal, and lingerie-frilled dresses from Kane’s first show, which I reviewed.)Chong gave the Kanes studio space to work out of Self-Portrait’s extensive headquarters in London’s Clerkenwell. He didn’t want anything watered-down. “He said, ‘We’ll make it work. I have factories and facilities in Asia.’ The quality is profoundly brilliant. It just feels like they’ve been hand-made because they’re so detailed. I was like, Wow.” Instead of his original neons, he’s chosen sweet baby pastels to chime with Self-Portrait’s signature palette.It’s funny to remember how Kane’s first collection came as a gleefully sensational fashion shocker. He was inciting girls to dress up, show off, and dance in defiance of depressing times and sober, minimal clothes. All these memories were fizzing through the crowd of Kane’s friends and peers—Erdem Moralioglu, Henry Holland, Clare Waight Keller, Susie Bubble, and Yu Masui—who’d lived it all the first time round. Funny, too, to think that a whole new generation will now be dancing around in his clothes. Some might even have been born on the very day of Kane’s debut: They’d be 17, going on 18, now.', 'It may be frightening to think about, but this generation of young kids are robbed of many simple life pleasures, like stumbling come across old movies on cable television. “When we millennials were young, we would just sit at home and watch old movies that came on TV,” reminisced designer Sergio Hudson. It’s true: Today, streaming services make choosing a film that much easier. There’s less spontaneity in the process, and less opportunity to come across unexpected gems you’d never watch otherwise. One such film—1967’s Valley of the Dolls, chronicling the rise and fall of three women in show business—happened to serve as the main inspiration for Hudson’s new spring collection. “I loved that movie—I used to watch it every time it came on,” he said. “It’s so campy!”If the designer took one aesthetic from the cult classic, it was most definitely the color palette. With the original costuming all set around a pastel cotton-candy fever dream of looks, Hudson wanted to apply the same sugary palette to his signature tailored suits, knit dresses, and evening gowns. “I’ve been in a dark place this year, so the color really lifted me,” he said. His double-breasted suits—always cut to perfection—came in lovely shades of lilac or robin egg blue. The sleeves were also given more of a pulled-up silhouette, for an added sense of fun and ease. “I wanted to offer some easier jackets, because my jackets are always so cinched and structured,” said Hudson. His relaxed evening looks, like a knit tee tucked into a high-waisted silk skirt, were done in butter yellow. They looked almost good enough to eat.Something fresh for the designer, meanwhile, was his foray into menswear. He felt it was time to introduce some pieces for him. “I’m always dressing women and their husbands go, ‘When are you making clothes for me?’ I’ve been hearing that for years,” said Hudson. His assortment felt perfectly in tune with the womenswear: he created pale pink single-breasted suits, minty green draped tops, and navy sequin tees—not your Average Joe pieces. “I really wanted to present something new and fresh, and [show] that we have range,” said Hudson.Given the 1960s reference of the Dolls, Hudson also experimented with more retro silhouettes, another first for him. This came through via Peter Pan collars and capped sleeves, added onto a double-breasted buttoned dress (very Mad Men) or floor-length sequin gown. Hudson said he isn’t a big fan of shimmer—but if he was paying homage to the Dolls, a little shine was a must. (Don’t miss the white long-sleeves sequin gown on ’90s supermodel Veronica Webb). “I’m more of a matte fabric person,” he said. “I like to call this minimal—but grand.”', 'There is no physical resemblance between Sharon Wauchob and Tinkerbell, but the designer’s hands seem to have the power of pixie dust, which allows anything they touch to fly. There’s no better way to describe Wauchob’s chiffons than that they look like shadows. Their almost unbelievable lightness is down to the quality of the French chiffons used and the designer’s experience working with them and with lingerie.Never have her chiffons been more romantic than they were for spring. The voluptuous and voluminous opening look was made of yards and yards of floaty fabric; other designs featured bias-cut ruffles that unfurled like fern fronds. A polka-dot printed number boasted heat-set Fortuny pleats. What allowed such decadent indulgence with chiffon, explained the designer on a call, was her complimentary use of jersey; the relative weightiness of this material, which works with gravity, provides a contrast to the flyaway quality of the chiffon. She used the knit for the asymmetrical draped Grecian column (Look 5), which was constructed with just one seam. (This editor couldn’t help but think there is some sort of spiritual link between Coco Chanel’s elevation of jersey and Wauchob’s.)Few garments are more redolent of ease than pajamas, and the designer returned to these for spring; also making a repeat appearance were the sleeve accessories (in sheer and solid options) that customers have so taken to over the past few seasons. They were paired with a camisole and what Wauchob referred to as her ’80s pants (pleated and wider) in Look 4; their addition gave a bubble silhouette to a polka-dot lace cami and tap pants set.In her collection notes, Wauchob said she’s been drawn to the pivot “between the opulent ’80s and the raw grit of the ’90s,” and open to embracing “contradictory moods, as we find ourselves again at the edge of change.” And yet there was no feeling of “dancing on the lip of the volcano” (a famous New York magazine title for a story about Christian Lacroix and the market crash) in Wauchob’s collection because her focus was on the in-between. The broad shoulders of the draped top (Look 7) were supported not by padding but by twisting the fabric, a bit in the manner of a Mobius strip.Newest this season was the focus on outerwear; Wauchob said she “wanted to show another note to the song” and set herself the challenge of bringing lightness to this more structured category. Through technical prowess, she managed to create a trench-kimono hybrid. The sleeves on the coat were slit, and you could fold the flaps in different ways or put your arms through them so that it looks almost like the coat is sitting on top of your body. A hooded cape created the shoulder span usually made with an inverted triangle cut, but the waist was actually curved in. This is not a time, Wauchob opined, for flatness and flat patterns, but for the movement and fluidity that three-dimensional draping allows. We must push forward, even if it is at a one-step-at-a-time cadence.', 'After presenting for a few seasons at Milan Fashion Week, Shuting Qiu showed her spring 2025 collection in Paris at the Palais de Tokyo. “Compared to Milan, Paris challenged me to think about the weather,” said Qiu. “Last time I was showing in a garden, now it’s a completely different atmosphere. Showing inside rather than outside affects styling and accessory choices too. I have to adapt my aesthetic to different markets.”After traveling to Cyprus last April, Qiu found the name of her collection in the island’s mythology: It is said that Venus was born there. Named The Palace Where Venus Descends, the show also made the designer reflect on romanticism. “Venus is the goddess of love, so I wanted my looks to be more romantic by adding moving elements such as fringes and flowers,” she explained. She collaborated with renowned artist Lu Xinjian to incorporate his iconic bold color contrasts and abstract lines into the designs.Musical patterns became an inspiration for prints as well, with dots covering different textiles, while a focus on shoulders showed up thanks to research on how women dressed in traditional attire. “Color-wise, the tints I chose relate to Cyprus’s historical buildings, then they were paired with my bright signature shades and mixed with black and white to create balance,” Qiu said. This time the designer skipped her usual mix-and-match approach to fashion, using only one color to create fractures.A new shoe design was added: A high heel featuring musical patterns became the key to the collection. Qiu also introduced kidswear this season. “We used textile leftovers to create the clothes,” she said. “It was very interesting to adapt my designs to children’s wear for my kind of aesthetic.” Lastly, the soundtrack reflected the collection’s theme by opening the show with a poem by Lena Platonos, a Greek electronic-music composer from the 1980s.', \"It’s been three seasons since Jonathan Simkhai staged a fashion show—a span that, in an industry which normalizes at least two per year, is an eternity. But with a successful rebrand (he dropped “Jonathan” from his eponymous label’s name in February 2023) a thriving international business (shop-in-shops have recently opened in Selfridges in London and Rubaiyat in the Middle East) and a keen understanding of the wants, needs and delights of his customers (the designer spent a month working at the Simkhai boutique in the Hamptons this summer) he no longer feels beholden to industry standards. “I really relieved myself of feeling like I have to do something just because everyone else is doing it or because I did it last time,” he said from his Manhattan office and atelier the day before presenting his spring 2025 collection. This season felt right because he loves the process and, having moved from New York to Los Angeles in 2018—where he employs many former New Yorkers—he and his team were pining for a return. But he also has something to say. Or, rather, a story to tell. And it’s a good one.“The inspiration for the collection came from a picture that I grew up staring at on my piano in our family living room,” he said. “It was a photo of my mother on her wedding day, and she was wearing this fabric. I'm going to show you the picture, because I think it's important.” Simkhai walked to a board awash with references to nature and American sportswear, but the most arresting was the photo of his mother, Orna, an actual blushing bride in a long-sleeve A-line gown made from a highly textured lace. The fabric was from his grandfather’s lace mill in Iran—unspooled from one of the few rolls he took with him when he left the mill and the life he knew behind during the revolution. And the wedding date? September 7, 1972. That the CFDA would schedule Simkhai’s show on his parents’ 52nd anniversary “was kismet,” he said, especially after he’d spent months finding ways to “modernize and pare back” all the texture in his mother’s wedding portrait.This was achieved in one instance by studying the X-ray of a flower, and mimicking the petal veins for an elaborate, cage-like embroidery on semi-sheer skirts and the stunning strapless finale dress. Elsewhere, 3-D flowers were cut from leather, embellishing a calfskin dress, a bandeau top, and a pencil skirt that hit just below the knee. Simkhai’s maternal grandmother loved butterflies, so dozens of the winged creatures were knitted for the overlay of a bright orange dress. “I tried to spin them so they wouldn't feel too…”\", \"The Old Bailey, London’s historic and still operating central criminal court, was the scene this evening of a Simone Rocha show whose collection was flagrantly and premeditatedly planned never to be an open-and-shut case. Instead it was rich in nuance, intrigue and insinuation. “When people see the collection I want them to have license to interpret it themselves” said Rocha at a preview, adding: “I’d never be interested in fashion that’s defining a look or defining how someone should feel.”One fact beyond reasonable doubt was that a core influence was dance. Michael Clark and Pina Bausch were cited as influences. Bausch’s Nelken (her carnation-strewn piece exploring extreme and traumatic love) had a significant cameo, lending its floral motif to this Rocha collection. Whether sprouting from the neckline of a gloriously severe tailored black dress, bunched in tulle bouquet handbags, worn as a crystal mesh in harness vests and dresses (made in-house), or embellished on hosiery, suiting or knickers, this flower bloomed across the collection. Rocha mentioned she was interested in its use as a buttonhole ornament in formal menswear, but that meaning was only one dimension here.\\xa0Other clear-cut elements were the knitwear ballet wrap cardigans and woolen coats from which arching sections had been sliced away. Hugged around the body and worn over tutus—as if the models were dancers mid-rehearsal nipping out for a stage door assignation—these coats incongruously resembled formal tailcoats. A tutu was elsewhere incorporated into a negligée to emphasize an ambiguity between the private and the performative.The curtain slowly rose beyond this rehearsal stage, presenting us with a diverse cast of carnation-garlanded characters. One couple—he in white shorts and vest, she in a beautiful mint sheath dress—were seemingly pressed and preserved within those garments by an over layer of opaque tulle below which were sandwiched more fabric carnations. A black silk satin dress featured a full skirt that had been pulled open at the front by the gesture of Rocha’s design to reveal the wearer’s underwear (also carnation embellished).The collection featured two images by Genieve Figgis, an artist who disturbingly recasts canonical paintings in artworks that seem as much dommage as homage. These transmitted a sense of chaos and turmoil lurking beneath the human surfaces. Menswear looks included ruffled, exaggeratedly pocketed technical silhouettes in lush duchesse silk. Ballet slippers with driving shoe soles, a fresh round of Rocha embellished Crocs, and some high shine duck handbags were amongst the accessories. We witnessed the premier of Rocha branded indigo denim, which came barely washed, white-stitched, and cut into full workwear shapes and harnessed to carnation metal and crystal botanical embellishments. A triple-bill of enormously bowed, lushly cut silk dresses and coats at the end seemed almost profligately lavish and lush pieces of human packaging.By contrast, the overwhelmingly narrow span of narrow body shapes in this show’s casting—which is unfortunately still common in London and across the global calendar of shows—was unwittingly emphasized by the sheer range of Rocha’s design spectrum. These were garments so multidimensional and heavy with meaning that the lack of variety in form and physique of those who wore them stood out. “What you project isn't always your reality,” Rocha had mused on an unrelated topic during our preview. Fashion’s enduring insistence on projecting such an unrepresentative reality is an injustice that has long worn thin, but which inexplicably never seems to wear out. That caveat notwithstanding, this Rocha collection demanded only one verdict: beautiful.\", 'Snow Xue Gao returned to what she does best after a few seasons of experimentation. This includes effortless girlish floral dresses and light blazers, which first put the designer on the 2018 LVMH Prize short list.But the brand has evolved from just making tailored suit blazers, and instead now wants to focus on tweed jackets after finding success with wool coats the past fall season and “soft-launching the tweed blazer design with some customers,” said Gao. “The feedback has been great, and this season we decided to spend much time developing more tweed.” The time spent paid off, resulting in New York–made tweed blazers that come in soft and romantic pastel colors that will pair well with the brand’s signature dresses.', 'The Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan’s pre-eminent gallery of public art, contains a wide selection of works by Italy’s finest old masters. In its central courtyard, however, is installed something else: a bombastic bronze statue of Napoleon that dates from the French occupation at the turn of the 19th century. This piece of propaganda portrays Bonaparte as a heroically semi-naked god of war: Mars “The Peacemaker.” Antonio Canova wisely applied the most flattering filter he could while sculpting it, so much so that Napoleon’s bare bronze bottom is one of the most-posted images from this treasure house of renaissance inventions, which today played host to the Sportmax spring collection.Once the show started you suspected the word sculptural had been bandied around the studio back in Reggio Emilia. Jersey dresses were hung from curtain cord collars to undulate down the front of the body while leaving the back—although not the full Napoleon—open to the elements. There were some fine 2D tunic dresses, very long, with deep V necklines. Inevitably there were some underwear as outerwear looks. As last season there were a few outfits in which the topside of pants were volumized in order to create a contrasting hyper-slimness in the waistlines above.Weirder moments included the clear plastic totes in which were carried a liter or two of water, and a semi-opaque lavender dress with a section of fringed clear beads that were held within the garment: This look appeared a challenge to walk in. The stronger looks tended to have one notable elaboration, like the penultimate black fringed dress whose straps wended over the shoulders way down to around the hips. This was a generally fine Sportmax collection, but it remains frustrating that a studio with such great resources and expertise is not dedicated to more purposeful practice.', '62-year old brand St. John is currently enjoying some time in the zeitgeist. This summer, the brand opened a splashy new flagship on Madison Avenue, whereas luxury resale website The Realreal reported that interest in its suits has never been higher. Then there’s Palm Royale, the Amazon Prime show, starring Kaia Gerber and Kristen Wiig, which has put sunny 1960s socialite style back in the spotlight. (St. John and Lilly Pulitzer were arguably two designers that exemplified the period’s glamorous fashion.)So St. John is taking this time to reintroduce its classics. Enrico Chiarparin, executive vice president of design, has been fastidiously at work updating some of Gray’s original designs from the ’60s. This season he debuted pastel crochet knit dresses and shorts, with modernized silhouettes and updated fabrics. Sewn into their collars were the brand’s original label from its founding year of 1962. What’s old is quite literally new.For his own creations, Chiaparin leaned into kiwi green and pink tweeds that felt right out of a Slim Aarons photograph. He said many of his pieces were Palms Springs and “desert inspired.” He looked at the bright yet arid landscape of the Southern California area, as well as the interior decor of local estates, for inspiration. (A jacquard suit, for example, took its cues from ’60s wallpaper.) Skirts and dresses boasted block floral prints, inspired by cactus flowers. There was also a playful Americana undertow in this collection: a tweed set came in red, white and blue; a ballgown skirt with a sparkle knit panel and cropped v-neck jacket color-coordinated in navy.Some pieces were structured. Many, however—including lace slip dresses and silk tops—were loose and flowy. “We were looking at more like a bohemian type of inspiration—hippy chic,” said Chiarparin. (Somewhat uncategorizable amid it all was a fringed leather skirt set. But hey, it seems the western trend is still going strong.)St. John is known for knits, and in this collection there were several knit pieces in a cacti color. For those who want to make less of a statement, Chiarparin did make a simple, 1990s-style white tank dress. But St. John? It’s always been about the colorful ’60s.', 'To be named the inaugural winner in a new category of the LVMH Prize is a monumental achievement. And as Michael Stewart said before today’s show, that category being dedicated to craft made it especially sweet. “To win the prize for savoir faire in Paris, where the culture is dedicated to that specific thing, is absolute insanity,” he said. Of the process of speaking with that organization’s formidable jury, he added, “These are all people who really understand craft.”Today, we saw another first for Stewart and Standing Ground: the label’s first solo runway outing. Because the designer only makes pieces to order (something he said he was repeatedly quizzed on back in Paris this week), it acted as a kind of trans-seasonal trunk show.Its closing khaki dress was the supreme example of Stewart’s celebrated technique. Two layers of jersey had been draped and cut over the wearer’s body, before Stewart drew the contours his instinct told him to apply. These drawings were then digitized to make\\xa0the design symmetrical and applied as stitching to the layers of jersey, before hundreds of micro-beads were inserted in the pockets of space that remained.\\xa0An adapted version of the same technique was applied to Stewart’s first-ever leather pieces: Lines of leather-wrapped beads ran vertically down the back of his jacket and coat in a form that resembled some semi-terrestrial’s spinal cord. Elsewhere, he fabric-submerged beads wound around little finlike ridges of padding peplum and sections of shirred and ruched material. All this crafted textural tension served to envelop the forms they clad in a statuesque embrace, while new experiments in lushly draped and sometimes cowled velvet had a Giovanni Strazza fluidity to them.\\xa0These clothes looked simultaneously ceremonial, futuristic, and ancient. To attempt to mass produce and wholesale pieces that evoke the meditative state Standing Ground musters would compromise what makes them so inherently special. Accessories, however, could represent a way to scale and support Stewart’s core venture as it expands.', 'There was recent discourse on X about how, to this day, Gwyneth Paltrow’s Donna Karan set from the movie Great Expectations has yet to be revamped to the exact great fit and quality as the original. Well, look no further than Sarah Staudinger’s spring collection. While the movie wasn’t the designer’s source of inspiration, this season she utilized the simple jersey fabric to create perfectly prestyled looks that give the ’90s touch the world so craves. “The jersey group was about the prestyled pieces that make layering easy. It’s not just all black and white; instead, you get the pops of color,” she explained. “We did variations on color-blocking, and you can really just wear these pieces and dress them up or down, and it’s easy.”It wasn’t just the jersey pieces that were effortless in Staudinger’s collection, but also the leather pants that came in a loose and baggier style perfect for summer evenings. They can be styled with a dressier knit, as is in the look book, or a vintage tee. Staud’s swimwear even appeared in the form of board shorts. As with any Staud collection, the accessories were the highlights. The classic Timmy shoulder bag got a beaded rework, and a new mesh tote joined the club. It even has an inner pouch for those items you want to conceal, and magnet detailing so you can keep it locked and in place.', 'Stella Jean once again finds herself rewinding the tape of her memories to build her latest collection, reviving a creative process where retrospection and introspection are indispensable tools. Quoting one of her favorite Luigi Pirandello novels for the collection’s title, One, None and One Hundred Thousand Kilometers, she seeks to frame the new Italian multicultural family portrait by intertwining international research with European symbols, both roots of her own existence.Deciphering the title, ‘one’ represents the designer’s adherence to Made in Italy, which encapsulates the essence of the brand’s origins and foundations. Italian heritage reveals itself through elements of trousseau, bridal dowry, delicate embroideries ,and intricate motifs on table linens and loungewear. “I took them from my mother-in-law’s wedding chest, Donna Mirella’s ’50s treasure,” Jean explained. The homage not only preserves the artisanal savoir-faire of bygone eras but also underscores the pressing necessity of safeguarding Made in Italy craftsmanship, where Jean anchors all of her production and manufacturing.Moving onto ‘none’, this concept stands for a journey that is now taken inwards. Here Jean is referring back to her father’s tailoring atelier influence, where shirt-making was a staple. “I have developed lots of new clothing categories made of striped poplin cotton this season: dresses, blouses, skirts, and vests all become the pairing passe-partout to prints,” she said.Lastly, ‘one hundred’ are the kilometers she metaphorically and physically traversed to engage with artisans of other cultures. From Haiti to Mali, with hints of Kenya, Kosovo, and Albania too, meticulously handcrafted objects appear in the collection in the form of exotic narrow cloth strips, colorful beads, interlaced sandals, and turbans folded onto urban hats. “The only way you have to survive a colonization, is not necessarily to resist it but to embrace it in a way that does not suffocate your own culture,” Jean said, bringing this abstract “urban sea”—as she defined it—into her world, even by making her models ironically pose in gray Milan with multicolored inflatables.', 'You’ve got to love Stella McCartney and frankly I do. Backstage after her terrific en plein air show this gray yet (finally!) dry Paris morning, McCartney was fielding questions about the collection she’d just shown. It had riffed on swaggering big shouldered suiting and capacious trenches (both very much in evidence these past few days) for day and plissé dresses and delicate lingerie with slouchy trousers for night. All of this came with some very ’80s sculpted Charles Jourdan–esque high sandals, flat boxing boots for the pugilist in us all, and a new duffel bag shape called the Ryder in vegan materials which came in every size from delicately petite to big enough to accommodate plenty of clothing changes for a three-day trip. Watching the proceedings: Natalia Vodianova, unsurprisingly (she and McCartney are friends); and, very surprisingly, Virginie Viard, who recently departed Chanel, and was there for a rare public appearance with her son Robinson Fyot. It was a lovely gesture of sisterly solidarity that McCartney excels at.Anyway: Back to the backstage. What was McCartney’s favorite look? The blue bubbly cloud of a mini dress crafted out of recycled plastic bottles, she said. The fact she’d put Mother on a tank? Because, she replied, we’re all mothers and we inhabit Mother Earth, so it’s a pretty good word—then adding, conspiratorially, but don’t tell anyone, the word fucker is in tiny print at the bottom. And a question on her favorite color led her to talk about blue skies, and ergo, birds, the whole inspiration for the collection. Birds had been used as a dove print, a golden avian in flight as a bra top, a necklace, a bangle, and a hefty bag charm, and were on the soundtrack courtesy of Prince’s “When Doves Cry” and a specially written word piece intonated at the show’s opening by Helen Mirren. McCartney took a breath. “We’re talking about not killing birds this season,” she said, “but a billion and a half birds are killed for fashion. Feathers belong on birds, so we can be inspired by them. This season was about being elevated, being a bird, being free and seeing things from a different perspective: masculinity, femininity.”This is classic McCartney, and is why, after being in business some 20-plus years, she retains her position as a creative force who’s willing to voice her criticisms of an industry which contributes—if one can use that word—to the environmental situation we currently find ourselves in, dancing not so merrily on the edge of a volcano. McCartney smartly understands the secret is to engage, and engage, and engage, again and again and again, every way you can: The About Fucking Time caps (she and PETA have used the phrase to highlight their new-ish campaign around animal welfare, or the lack thereof) which sat on every seat; the copies of The Stella Times which were also there, a newspaper filled with facts and statistics; and more generally, the way she fuses hard and unpalatable truths with that tongue-in-cheek British sense of humor of hers to make people hopefully think. Her clothes today were great, really great, but when you consider everything else she is doing to sound the alarm on a situation which is likely heading towards a worrying unknown, you can only regard her with the greatest of respect.', 'The spontaneous hand-drawn beauty of Steve O Smith’s work has to be seen to be believed. Over London Fashion Week, passersby at Dover Street Market stopped dead to marvel at the inside-and-out perfectionism of a few pieces of his spring collection hanging on a rail. It was like looking at 3D black-and-white freehand life drawings caught in air.There were price tags, yes, but this was the opposite of a see-now-buy-now situation. Smith is the latest to emerge in the vanguard of young London designers who are making things to order, as do Michael Stewart and Richard Quinn.The buzz around Smith exploded at the Met Ball in May, when Eddie Redmayne and his wife, Hannah Bagshawe, wore pieces he’d made for them from the look book he posted last season. “That experience really pushed my techniques, figuring out how everything must look in 360 degrees, from every angle,” Smith said. “Afterwards, I went home to London and drew for three weeks straight.”His second collection flowed from the graphic inspiration he’d gleaned from studying the work of the Weimar Republic artist George Grosz. Immersed in the free and decadent culture of Berlin in the 1920s and ’30s, he hit on Pandora’s Box, the silent movie by G.W. Pabst that made the provocative Louise Brooks into a wild sensation of the flapper era.What captivated Smith was “her expressiveness, vulnerability, and kinetic energy,” he said. “At that time, audiences were shocked by confronting her movement onscreen.” Dozens of speed drawings later, he transferred the sketches he liked best onto black appliqués running over calico or organza. As minutely painstaking as his technique is—tiny stitching, delicate finish—the energy of his artist’s hand vibes over everything from tailoring to menswear to the breathtaking lightness of his one-shoulder evening gown (a “gesture dress,” he called it).Smith’s Lulu collection landed somewhere adjacent to the 1920s-ish period that other designers are thinking around this season. And yet again, its freshness and originality couldn’t be more alive. Smith is off to Paris to take orders in a showroom he’s rented to show his collection to clients. “It’s really interesting and rewarding, speaking to people who have the patience to order and wait,” Smith said. “That’s how I want to work—to build a modern atelier.”', 'You wouldn’t expect anything less than radical from Sunnei’s Simone Rizzo and Loris Messina as they marked their 10th anniversary. There wasn’t a traditional birthday cake in sight at their show; instead, it offered a reflection on aging, the passage of time, and growing older. But in true Sunnei fashion, it was irreverent and far from conventional. The entire cast consisted of individuals of a certain age, artists and friends of the house not younger than 70 or 80, proudly showcasing their wrinkles and graying hair with absolute aplomb.They looked fantastic (and inspiring) in Sunnei’s straightforward designs, which this season took a celebratory turn for the theatrical. A cotton shirred top featured a humongous cloudlike ruched capelet; an impactful, voluminous trapeze dress with billowing proportions was printed with bold diagonal stripes; and enigmatic illustrations by Messina’s mother, Marylène Fantoni, from the 1980s were reproduced on what resembled a kooky ball gown—the first specimen of Sunnei couture perhaps?Ten Years Feel Like a Hundred was the title of the show, staged in the minimalist, polished white gallery of art-world powerhouse Lia Rumma. Marina Abramović and Juergen Teller sat on small wood stools alongside a select group of loyal friends and editors who have supported the label’s bravado over the past decade. “We’re turning 10 and we still haven’t managed to get a Wikipedia page,” they joked amid the joyful mayhem that followed the show.For once, they chose not to over-ruminate on the deeper meaning of their performative show, leaving the audience to reflect on what was likely the first fashion show in history with an all-senior cast. The message was powerful enough to need time to sink in. “It can’t be fully conveyed in words, and that’s intentional,” they explained. However, true to their intellectual nature, they still offered their own insights.“Nobody knows what Sunnei will look like in 90 years—and none of us will be here to witness it,” they mused. “These past 10 years have been so intense, they felt like a century. So we thought, why not stretch that idea and project the fashion show a hundred years into the future, to 2124? We wanted to enter a no-time zone—a distorted future where time becomes so dense that it almost dissolves, ceasing to exist. No trends, no overthinking, no overdesign. There’s no pressure or anxiety about growth, whether personal or as a brand—the obsession with constant growth is absurd. The fashion industry is aging. Milan is aging. We’re merely amplifiers of these paradoxes. There’s no need to celebrate anything. Age is irrelevant—whether it’s 10, 100, 2, or 85. They’re just numbers. There’s no melancholy or sorrow in growing older. At Sunnei, nobody is old.”', 'Talia Byre was feeling confident this season—and so too was her woman. When the designer speaks of this person, someone she refers to a great deal, she isn’t imaginary. She exists, and she needs clothes to wear. And Byre knows what this woman wants to wear before she even knows what she wants to wear.Thus far she has stayed true to Byre’s signatures: rugby tops with bias stripes, paneled trumpet skirts, crunchy bomber jackets, fitted jersey cardigans, and a playful minidress called the Bambino. For spring, these trademarks took on new guises. The rugbys came in a purple-striped pattern, with ruffled hemlines, and a high-shine disco jersey—which someone could wear with matching briefs, if they dare!—inspired by glossy, gummy Pipilotti Rist sculptures Byre saw in New York earlier this year. The jackets, which tapped into the ’80s references she looked at this season and her animal muse (crows), were exaggerated at the shoulders with gathered popped collars; cardigans arrived with Dennis the Menace stripes and a soft, hand-painted deer print by Harriet Cox. “Preppy but glam” is how Byre described it.“This is like a cat burglar,” she said, pointing at menacing striped capri pants complete with a matching drawstring bag on a chain. The Dennis the Menace reference was intentional. In fact, several cartoons—Scooby-Doo, The Flintstones—informed elements throughout the collection. Did Byre watch them during the design process or hark back to her fragmented memories of watching them as a child? The latter, it figures. Nostalgia was an overarching theme but not wholly in a literal way: “They remind me of the girls I went to school with,” she said of the individual looks.There’s a new contender in the foundational Talia Byre arsenal: the wrap dress, whose multi-wear silhouette was achieved after draping. Byre wore one as coffee-holding guests gathered to hear her proposition for spring. There were also new materials, including a two-tone shearling, seen as a waistcoat; a miniskirt that had a top part like tights so it fit under, say, a cashmere jumper (it comes as a full-fuzz miniskirt sans hosiery upper too); and suede, from which her belts and barrel bags were made this season.The mix-and-match capabilities of Byre’s pieces are very well suited to everyday wear, but she wanted to sprinkle in a dash of drama. Artistic illustrations danced across tights, while lace cuttings left over from working on her first bespoke bridal look—designed and fitted alongside her main line—became veils on beanies designed by collaborator James Pink, whom she met while studying.“We just had a good time making it,” she said of the team’s energy. “This is quite a real collection—me and the girls in the studio can wear it.” The day after her London appointments, she goes to New York to show her collections Stateside. Talia Byre is meeting more Talia Byre women at every turn.', 'When Tanner Richie and Fletcher Kasell began ideating their spring 2025 presentation, they thought of featuring the artist Jeanette Getrost, tasking her with transforming one of their white gowns into something new. “We really like her work, so we didn’t give much direction,” said Richie. What could Getrost do with a blank canvas, particularly one alive and on the influencer and model Dylan Mulvaney? What an artist’s dilemma.And that is just what the designers titled this collection: “The Artist’s Dilemma.” “It’s our own personal dilemma, in a way,” said Kassel, with Ritchie expanding: “We have so many ideas and now we touch so many categories that sometimes we have to pick and choose what we can do.” Since launching their label almost five years ago with a run of tote bags and tees, the design duo has rapidly expanded across lifestyle, bridal, menswear, womenswear, and everything in between. Such growth is certainly exciting, but it’s not an easy thing to pull off this early on.Kasell and Ritchie have, minus the usual growing pains hiccups, stuck the landing. “We’ve upped the quality quite a bit now,” said Kassel. Expanding their wholesale and direct-to-consumer business has increased their orders, which has allowed them to level up their production partners. This change was most noticeable in the womenswear, which this season seemed to find the sweet spot between what customers and retailers are asking for and what Kasell and Ritchie want to make. A prim corseted dress with a full circle skirt meticulously gathered at the hip was a shining example, as was a yellow checkered jacket covered in sheer sequins. “The main improvements of the season come in the women’s,” said Kasell. “We’ve had a substantial offer in menswear for a while, so it was a little unbalanced until now.”Most importantly, scaling has enabled Kasell and Ritchie to start drawing outside the lines some more. They faced white lace with PVC to make a fabulous trench coat, created a few playful bloomers (an ongoing trend, believe it or not, but one that worked well here), and rendered some of their signature silhouettes in swishy nylon, black and gingham, to give them a fresh spin. They were weird, fun, and effective. It’s this kind of thinking that will help them keep things interesting now they’ve built such a singular world.Today’s presentation was arranged as a series of vignettes. Models polished silver, sharpened pencils, spun wool, exercised, or, in the case of Mulvaney, posed statuesquely. Her dress was covered in little black bows by the end of the show—a Tanner Fletcher signature. Sometimes the best way out of a dilemma is going back to the basics.', 'Tanya Taylor’s spring collection was based around her idea of a perfect day. For the designer and artist, that would involve painting and cruising between her studio and an art-supplies store on a skateboard. “When you’re in an art store, you feel like all your tools are around; you could create anything. And there’s something about someone on a skateboard that’s pure freedom. It’s like the wind in your hair and the control of where you’re going.” With all this in mind, Taylor’s goal was to create a day-off kind of feeling to the collection; she didn’t want things to look too polished or perfect. Styling a pretty pistachio satin dress with a twisted strap with slippers didn’t push the idea far enough; relaxed trousers in beige and apricot that you could wear with any number of cute tops, from a gingham bikini to tie-back peplum halters or a slouchy marinière sweater, did.As usual, Taylor created the prints for the season. The boldest was of tulips, printed on a T-shirt and on pleated skirts once they had been produced, so when you sit or move, the print would be interrupted. A gingham-front trench coat was fun; from the back, the only hint of what lay ahead was the checked collar. In terms of investments, you couldn’t go wrong with a long, sleeveless, scoop-neck denim column with corset seaming: It was flirty, fitted, and fab. Also strong was a LBD–tennis dress hybrid with buttons down the extended front that opened up into a fuller skirt. A white short top with cutouts edged in green and puffed sleeves could similarly be dressed up or down.This felt like a little-bit-of-everything collection; there was gingham, eyelet, stripes, knits, cutouts, denim, satin, beading, and more. This was in keeping with the theme, a free-pass-to-do-as-you-please day, yet the collection seemed tighter than the preceding ones. Taylor pointed out that the dress buyers gravitated to was Look 24, a butter yellow sheath with a full skirt with thin bands of black threaded eyelet at the princess sleeves, and wider ones at the side of the waist. It was a bit ’60s Lily/Jackie/Camelot and quite nostalgic. Which vibes with Taylor’s own effusive mood: “I love connecting back to what my youthful state of mind was,” she said. “And my youthful state of mind was always about freedom.” Let it ring.', 'At a time when many independent designers in London are struggling, Alice Temperley offers a glimmer of hope. The brand, best known for its heavily embellished evening dresses, is opening a new store in Kensington in October, while also expanding its ready-to-wear offering, the White Label, as it begins wholesaling again. “During Covid, we were more evening wear and bridal focused. Now we’re growing,” Temperley explained, noting that both the US market and younger customers are key priorities. “That’s why it’s important to do ready-to-wear, because not everybody goes around wearing evening wear.”The White Label is an expansion of the Temperley world, with the Somerset-based designer being the archetypal customer. “I live in knitted suits, so we’re doing more [of those],” said Temperley, pointing to her houndstooth two-piece. This season, there’s a monogrammed version, emblazoned with the designer’s T logo, and another in black and white. Taking inspiration from a trip to Barcelona, there are lighter pieces featuring floral cut-out detailing, referencing the relief work at the Sagrada Familia, which are likely to have broad appeal.The Spanish influence continued into the evening wear, via the ruffled Flamenco sleeves, and intricate embroidery and beadwork that referenced the tiles at Park Güell. As ever, Temperley is keen to emphasize the craftsmanship that goes into creating her designs, launching digital product passports—a QR code on the tag that you scan—that allow customers to find out more about how each piece was made, and its carbon footprint.After nearly 25 years in business, Temperley prides herself on the fact that she’s not swayed by the trend cycle, staying true to her brand’s DNA and what her loyal clientele wants. “It’s about embracing what we know, what we love, and what we do, and sticking to it—not trying to be something else,” she reflected.', 'The belted rave pants Anna Teurnell introduced for resort returned for spring with lots of pockets. The reasons for this, and the hanging pockets on draped gabardine skirts, were practical as well as aesthetic. For security reasons, bags are not allowed at big venues in Sweden, including Gothenburg’s Way Out West music festival. “I don’t like that it is like that,” said the designer on Zoom, “but it’s such a concrete example of how the politics and the world around you can affect what you do.”\\xa0Limitations can encourage creativity—not that Teurnell needs much nudging when it comes to creating or putting a look together. She’s someone who seems to think in total looks as she designs, considering accessories as well as garments. She topped spring outfits with a leather sun hat and grounded some of them with not quite orthopedic but rounded ballerina flats.\\xa0Teurnell’s sense of proportion is acute—this season’s jeans were tighter at the rear, the trousers flared—as is her feeling\\xa0for quality materials. Those trousers were made of a cavalry textile Teurnell sourced from a specialist firm in England. The luxe knit sweater, tucked into a pair of light-wash denim long shorts, is a double knit. The surprise element was the cotton bow blouse it was layered over.\\xa0Teurn Studios is picking up steam; it will soon be carried by Bergdorf Goodman and Nordstrom. The “secret” to the brand’s success is that the clothes are grounded in Teurnell’s own style. “It’s how I dress myself; add on something that is a more basic men’s style look and…[then something] feminine can come in,” she said of one look, but it’s a sentiment that applies across the board. For spring, those pretty somethings included a leather ruffled top to wear on or off the shoulders and a pajama-like set in different shades of “makeup” pink.', 'Who hasn’t experienced a breakup? If you haven’t, raise your hand. Chances are, such a person doesn’t walk the earth. In unexpected synchronicity, Giorgia Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio both ended their relationships around the same time. Like most matters of the heart, it just happened—and apparently it wasn’t a bed of roses. Typically reserved, despite their party girl status, the duo chose to drop the veil of privacy that has surrounded their personal lives and address it openly. They expressed this through the spring show, their most personal yet, aptly titled The Sound of Breaking Glass.Set in a vast, raw industrial space that served as a metaphor of the bruised emotions often left in the wake of a breakup, the show exuded the slouchy, undone glamour that The Attico girls have mastered so well. Hundreds of glass chandeliers hung from the ceiling, hinting at the fragility of a broken heart. Their openness in revealing emotional wounds was mirrored in the sheer chiffon and lace layers that barely concealed the body. Yet, the strength to rise above despair was captured in the seductive, shimmering pieces with a vintage flair, profusely embroidered or strategically shredded, designed to make any woman feel vibrant and beautiful once more. “But no, this is not revenge dressing!” they declared.As is typical with The Attico, oversized, roomy sportswear was played against the decadence of form-fitting numbers, topped off with feathered headpieces that exuded a prima donna vibe. XXL cargo pants with trailing straps were paired with sequined and lace-embellished lingerie tops; oversized, rugged parkas were layered over fringed, sequined dresses reminiscent of 1920s flappers. A broad-shouldered, cinched-waist blazer with cropped flared pants had a slightly faded look, as if time had left behind a patina of memories that slowly vanish. A broken heart would certainly mend faster and easier when dressed in one of The Attico’s fabulous pieces.', 'At the Elder Statesman, Greg Chait and Bailey Hunter are busy growing their creative universe. “This season, we explored going a lot more into wovens and cut-and-sew, and expanding our materials library,” Hunter said via Zoom from Los Angeles. Their spring 2025 look book opens with a proper khaki linen coat with an asymmetrical lapel that had been dip-dyed in fuchsia. There are also wide-leg trousers and explorer jackets in Italian cotton, flirty silk separates in a bold geode print, and a classic “denim” jacket and matching pants with color-blocked cashmere inset on the side seams, except it wasn’t denim at all but a cotton canvas woven through a special technique that gave it a kind of marled denim effect.The collection was inspired by crystals but also the whole world of characters around them. “All the people who would go to the gem show: geologists, gem collectors, dealers, and people who use them for spiritual practices and healing,” Hunter explained. From these colorful natural formations emerged a vibrant palette that was grounded by khakis and browns and earth tones borrowed from “the geologist sector,” as Chait called it. Terra-cotta-hued knits with an intarsia “crystal” pattern in shades of blue, yellow, and white and a long knit dress with an abstract geological map pattern in shades of orange, gray, and mustard stood out for their unexpected color combinations. But the designers also leaned into bold colors with striped dresses and separates, and another dress in black with a neon shell pattern. Elsewhere, it was their attention to detail that shone brightest. Buttons were traded for small geodes, rocks, or sea glass on coats and cardigans, and one cashmere sweater had a small amethyst “encased in a little crocheted hammock” near the collar. “We were talking about potentially using different crystals and then writing on the tag what the property of each crystal is,” Hunter added. Talk about retail therapy.', \"Rewind back to Paris Fashion Week in March when The Row radically requested that guests refrain from using their phones during the show. And how this confirmed the brand’s hold over everyone, the request respected.Whether out of residual observance or simply owing to the tedium of tapping, I arrived at The Row’s Paris headquarters for our morning appointment with a notebook and pen, taking a few photos for reference only when the team welcomed me to do so. My penmanship not being what it used to be, “a meditation on casual wear” and “wardrobing in an elevated way” were among the notes that appear legible. But it hardly matters what was written down, as the collections were entirely memorable, impeccably nonchalant as ever. They also came with a few surprises—uncharted territory, even.Similar to previous visits, the first salon featured the greatest number of mannequins wearing Row-ified transformations of classic and/or basic clothes that express different stylistic whims. How I fought the temptation to recline into the 1960s rattan daybed so that my eye could wander across the reworkings of a standard blue workwear jacket, a bookish vest, and a sleeveless tartan sheath held up by two shoulder ribbons. After those pieces, it would have landed on the unfettered layering of an oversized jumper, tiered lace lingerie dress, and slouchy jeans, or else the vibrant red and blue checked cotton linen (as opposed to flannel) loosely draped as a skirt and paired with a pale yellow polo. Further on were evening silhouettes—one a cascade of metal embroidery, another embedded with sculptural rings around the neck and upper arms—that will epitomize elegance circa 2025.The studio puts effort into iterating its tailoring, all-season leather pieces, and covetable bags (Marlo, with its rounded outlines, launches as an offshoot of the phenom that is Margaux); the men’s range is as well-developed as the women’s. Yet the patterned pieces and color accents, random bits of craft, and leveled-up foam flip-flops also seem noteworthy since they deviate from how we perceive the brand. With its 20th year on the horizon, perhaps The Row is taking itself less seriously, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen taking a chill view towards fashion. Here, in this non-runway ambiance, where an eclectic mosaic coffee table and cowhide Adnet chairs are among the pieces selected from prestigious Parisian galleries, while Grateful Dead and Bob Marley play at noticeable volume, signs point to a kind of grown-up grunge beyond the realm of quiet luxury.The just-opened shop in Amagansett will certainly benefit from a high concentration of eager customers. Given The Row's commitment to Paris with its showroom and studio, one can only hope a store might emerge in time to purchase the hybrid boots in mesh and leather; the To Go tote (a compact leather book bag); or any of the coats in washed or vintage cotton. The ultimate fantasy would be the entire wardrobe, an outfit per day. First up, the simple black top and gauzy white pants, s’il vous plait.\", 'It’s been a minute since Edvin Thompson staged a show in the city, so it was a shame that his buzzy return to New York Fashion Week today was clouded by a seriously late start time. If only one could say it took a minute—more like 76. The show started just over an hour and fifteen minutes after its allotted start time. It’s all good. Things happen. Yet it must be said that this is no way to stage a grand return—sometimes second impressions matter more than firsts.\\xa0Backstage as folks waited in the lobby of the Freehand hotel—including Lil Nas X and June Ambrose—Thompson was all good vibes: “We’re late, but it’s going to be a great show for sure,” said the designer with a giggle.\\xa0Thompson has been busy at work setting the foundation of his label. The designer said in a recent interview with The Business of Fashion that the label is breaking even for the first time as he aims to expand his distribution and supply chain. Lots of exciting developments somewhat hinging on the success of this show. He returned to the runway here after three seasons, but made a point to note that Theophilio didn’t go anywhere. “It feels like I never left,” he said. “People said ‘Theophilio is on hiatus,’ but I’ve been here, I was still working, still shaping my identity.”\\xa0That was the theme here. Thompson titled his collection “Shaunie” after his childhood nickname, which he said he received from his mother’s side of the family. This lineup, he said, celebrated the “grander self.” Thompson can cut a flattering silhouette, and here he doubled down on the sparkle and sex appeal that made him one to watch when he broke into the scene just a couple of years ago. He offered colorful silk separates covered in clusters of tonal sequins, menswear styles with scattered peekaboo grommets, and cool graffiti printed slips and micro dresses. “I used to shy away from loud prints and bold colors when I started in fashion because I wasn’t so comfortable with my sexuality in that way,” he said, “I felt that if I was bright I would attract attention to myself, but leaning into the discomfort, into who you are, that’s growth.”\\xa0Thompson’s spirit is in the right place. Tonight he had a room full of good will, of people happy to wait to see his work and support him. That kind of community is hard to come by, let alone create this early on. One would have hoped to see more evolution in his output and a little more finesse after his time in stealth mode. This was a show of Theophilio staples, some more effective than others. But as Thompson very well said, discomfort leads to growth. Perhaps next season he’ll dare to draw outside the lines.\\xa0', 'For Tibi’s spring collection, Amy Smilovic and her team were looking to push themselves and “be reckless.” Their clothes are unlikely to ever read that way, but what Smilovic was referring to was the fact that anything goes during her creative process. “We are grounded but at the same time we want to see how far we can push things and still feel like ourselves,” she said.Suiting played a starring role in the collection, and tailored separates had subtle details that declared to the world, “I’m not a regular jacket, I’m a cool jacket” and meant it. On the opening look, a single-breasted blazer had a button at the lapel so that you can wear it closed at the neck, which created a kind of mandarin collar; one jacket seemed to have been hybridized with a bomber; another was liberally sprinkled with a few welt pockets as decoration. Smilovic’s take on tailoring is above all easy, and is well suited for people that like to wear suits for fun and those who have to wear suits to work. The fact that Smilovic featured many male models wearing those exact same suits is further proof of her one-size-fits-all-stylish-denizens approach. She also played with tech-y fabrics, turning the classic windbreaker into a slouchy blouson-ish top, and adding a groovy exposed zipper down the front of track pants.The big news this season, perhaps, was an emphasis on an extra dropped-waist silhouette: low slung pants and skirts are a given, but more novel was a sweater with belt loops at the hem, worn with an asymmetrical striped skirt. A handkerchief-esque skirt was designed to be worn tied up or down, and many other garments featured swooping panels that added unexpected volume to otherwise straightforward silhouettes. The pair of parachute dresses that closed the show showed so much movement that this reviewer looked around to see where the fan was blowing from, but there was none, of course.', 'There’s a cool clarity to Bryan Conway’s new collection for Tiger of Sweden that is absolutely refreshing. Whereas in the past it has felt like the designer was hesitating at the edge of the diving board, for spring 2025 he dove unhesitatingly into things while also bringing the work closer to home. Consider an irresistible wrinkled suit in a cotton fabric that has some metal in it to retain its well-worn feeling. It is based on the first tailleur Conway made when studying in London. Back then, the designer said, he’d “just got over my Hedi Slimaine for Dior phase and I got out of those skinny jeans I used to wear.” The remit then, as now, is for ease with sophistication. The combination of wool-silk pajama-like pants with a drawstring and a slightly leaner jacket (a general trend this season) feels just right. And the jacket’s exaggeratedly wide lapel is suggestive of both the transitional period Conway had in mind (the ’60s segueing into the ’70s) and that of a boy becoming a man.It’s better to call David Hockney the motivating spirit rather than inspiration of this collection because Conway was thinking as much about the way the artist “approaches art” as the man himself. Yes, aspects of the stylish painter’s wardrobe make their way into this offering, but the point was not to be too literal. In fact, we get closer to the designer through Hockney than ever before.“ I think he probably means a lot of things to a lot of people,” said the designer, who is a Brit, like the artist. “It’s really telling a bit of my story kind of through him.” It turns out Conway himself was the missing piece of the puzzle in last season’s Tiger of Sweden collection, which felt true to the brand identity and heritage but impersonal.Spring’s lineup is freer and more confident, with clothes that are straightforward and desirable. A terrific liquid column with a twisted T-strap is made of a cold-washed silk that gives it a bit of a watery pool effect in the subtlest of nods to Hockney. Conway prefers deep cuffs this season, shorts for men and culottes for women. The formality of tailoring is softened by pairing a suit with a striped knit shirt. A dress might be worn with a boat shoe, a casual outfit with a tasseled loafer. The uncomplicated confidence of this collection suggests a sunlit existence, like the one depicted in Hockney’s paintings, and perhaps in the opening pages of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s greatest work. A smashing double-breasted white suit has all the sleek sophistication of Jay Gatsby, as portrayed by Robert Redford. These are clothes for living the dream.', \"Matteo Tamburini took Tod’s on a Mediterranean journey, infusing the spring collection with a breezy sense of ease and subtle nods to sportswear. His moodboard featured images of Italian summer landscapes captured by photographer Luigi Ghirri, alongside Carlo Borlenghi's regatta photography and primitive Cycladic sculptures. The Italian cycling champion Fausto Coppi also made an appearance. Tamburini had shared these references on Instagram, along with pictures from an old editorial of an elegant minimalist dress captioned “A perfect reminder of how simplicity and bold design can still captivate.” This clarity of purpose pretty much summarizes the approach to creative direction he has brought to Tod’s.The brand’s devotion to craftsmanship was highlighted at the show’s venue, where on long worktables 60 artisans from Tod’s factory gave a live demonstration of how Gommino moccasins are assembled. To further showcase the fatto a mano credentials, a majestic sculpture by artist Lorenzo Quinn—depicting two giant hands holding a ribbon—was prominently displayed on the runway.Crafted mostly from leather treated to achieve malleable textures, the collection explored the play between structure and fluidity. Tamburini, who was formerly Bottega Veneta’s head designer, treaded lightly on references, focusing on a sense of ease without detracting from the appeal of inventive design.Subtle nods to the lightness of sails introduced dynamic volumes, as in a cotton parka with an attached, billowing cape. The archetypal sculptural spareness of Cycladic votive statues was echoed in bold silhouettes that had presence, yet looked effortless. Classic vertical draping was reimagined in a long fluid chiton in forest green pleated leather, as well as in the final look worn by Mariacarla Boscono—a striking black column gown with a peplum detail.At the press conference, when asked whether he thinks bold design choices are still viable in today’s circumstances, Tamburini responded: “The challenging environment we face now doesn’t exactly encourage taking risks or embracing daring experimentation. Designers are often confronted with a choice: They can either conform their creative vision to the demands of marketing and play it safe, or they can opt for a more courageous, innovative approach. I chose to pursue the latter, to create something more impactful.”\", 'There was a celebratory air to tonight’s Toga show in London, which was held in a gallery space at Somerset House—and marked Yasuko Furuta’s return to the runway after a four-year hiatus. While this break was initially prompted, unsurprisingly, by the pandemic, Furuta has used her seasonal collections in the years since as a springboard for a variety of more experimental creative projects, including a film by Johnny Dufort and an art photography series by Liv Liberg. These diversions may have suited Furuta nicely—her cerebral approach to design is informed by her close relationship with the Tokyo art world, so her forays into more inventive modes of presenting her clothes never feel like a gimmick—but there’s still nothing like a live show to get the blood pumping.Thankfully, Furuta’s return to the runway did just that. The tone was set with two opening looks: a pair of roomy trench coats with puff sleeves, worn over blouses with checkered handkerchief details at the neck, first on a female model and then a male. Furuta has always taken a somewhat genderless approach to her design, but her inquiries into masculinity, in particular, this season were prompted by watching Claire Denis’s 1999 masterpiece Beau Travail, which charts a tale of obsession between French soldiers stationed in Djibouti. (To wit, the show’s mellow soundtrack concluded with a seat-shaking blast of Corona’s “The Rhythm of the Night,” which accompanies Beau Travail’s iconic final scene.)Other highlights included a series of high-waist dresses cut from shimmering metallic jacquards and a series of riffs on motorcycle jackets, cropped and asymmetric, in jet black and blazing red. Artfully draped dresses carried a satisfying swish, while the razor-sharp tailoring played with proportions, pairing linebacker shoulders with cinched waists. There was the charming addition of roses, bunnies, and butterflies as brooches to bring a touch of sweetness. And a special shout-out, too, for the killer shoes, which took the steel-toe caps of traditional workwear boots and expanded them into spearlike, hand-finished golden cones.Furuta opted for a salon-style show, with the intimacy meaning you could truly see the clothes (and also occasionally see yourself, thanks to the reflective gold panels on the floor). This is the kind of fashion that deserves to have every detail absorbed, after all: rigorously designed but playful, avant-garde but accessible, meticulously constructed but still unfussy. It’s great to have Furuta back on the runway.', 'The Leaning Tower of Pisa featured on Iniye Tokyo James’s invitation for today’s show, which was apt. “The collection’s called Imperfection,” he said backstage. “Life is not perfect. So why should clothes be perfect? It touches on the ups and downs we all go through every day.”This twist, once known, placed the onlooker in a fun predicament. James said he’d inserted multiple imperfections in his garments and presentation more broadly: So would we spot them? The sunburn makeup was a straightforward starter. The beaded skirt with two skew-whiff beads and the haphazardly stitched seaming on denim, leather, and jersey were so wrong they were clearly right. Uneven hems were purposefully imperfect gems. But what about the right shoe in Look 7: Was its refusal to stay securely afoot an accident designed or spontaneous? And were the minidresses cut so high at the back really meant to show quite so much cheek?Consistent with his imperfect theme was the fact that 90% of the materials in this collection were, James said, upcycled deadstock from sources in Benin, Nigeria, the UK, and Italy. An unlined black blazer and shorts that transitioned halfway down their lengths into thickly intertwined woven strips had to be prototyped four times, James added, before they were perfected in the factory. The belt they were worn with was decidedly wrong.', 'At the tail end of one of the busier days of London Fashion Week, walking into Tolu Coker’s show this evening felt like being welcomed home. Walls papered with poppy ’70s graphics were hung with photographs of proud Black women, posing in puff-sleeved dresses and sculptural head wraps, or caught candidly dancing in fine knit vests worn over poplin shorts and pleated plaid skirts. Rather than your typical humdrum chairs, the runway was lined with mid-century furniture and home decorations that gave the room the feeling of a large-scale Michael McMillan installation—teak sofas with deep pile marigold cushions; a fully laid dinner table, decked with bowls laden with tropical fruit; bookcases with shelves lined with hand-carved ebony busts.The intention, the designer explained post-show, was on one level an homage to Olapeju Coker, her dear mother (tributes to mothers being something of a trend this season, following on from Chet Lo on Friday). “In Yoruba, her name means wealth gathers,” Coker explained. “I really wanted to tap into our culture and how names can carry such significant meaning.” The collection was also an exploration of the significance of living room spaces in the collective psyches of London’s myriad immigrant communities. “I was really looking back at the emotions and feelings I felt growing up in my childhood home, but also in the pictures of living rooms that I would see in my late father, Kayode Coker’s, archives,” the designer said. “They were from the late ’60s and early ’70s, but I felt that sensitivity as a child, and it led me to look deeper into stories of immigration and how the living room has been this sort of gathering space, especially for working-class people. It’s looking at the wealth that exists within these communities.”These notions were poignantly fleshed out in the collection that filed down the runway, a joyfully nostalgic, though still contemporary offering sported by models in sculptural beehives and flippy hairspray-held dos. Tailoring served as a pillar, with elegant leather Harringtons and sporty oversized denim separates showcasing some impressive cutting skills—the jackets of the latter looks were particularly striking, featuring corsetry detailing at the waist and lace-up back, plus intricate, in-built bust constructions. Elsewhere, swinging 1960s flair was channeled with gusto by halterneck waistcoats paired with pleated ra-ra skirts, cropped vests, micro-skirts, A-line dresses and even an umbrella printed with warm, lysergic swirls.', \"Haider Ackermann’s headline-making appointment as creative director of Tom Ford earlier this month may have rendered the Milan presentation of this interim studio-produced collection eminently missable, but watching it climb up the Vogue Runway rankings since the images were posted proves there’s power in the Ford name even without a well-known designer in the hot seat.\\xa0Though it lacked the wicked touch that Ford used to bring to his shows, a quality that Peter Hawkings’s short-lived run was also missing, this collection otherwise held to the brand codes. There was the sexy slink of knits, often shot through with metallic yarns, and there was the kind of boss tailoring that made Ford's menswear such a hot commodity. Especially strong was a sharply cut jacket in pinstripe wool, and nighttime versions of the same silhouette in fabrics with a velvety sparkle. A to-the-floor T-shirt dress in tiny silver beads was the winner among the evening options; it’d be as easy to wear as it is statement-making.\\xa0Also in the mix were buttery leather jacket-and-skirt sets, a silky jumpsuit that called to mind the ’70s of Halston, and a plethora of sporty short-shorts. Having tracked Ackermann’s particular brand of vagabond chic for over a decade, it’s hard to imagine those shorts in the Tom Ford brand’s future, but only time will tell. Next stop: Paris, where Ackermann will present his debut collection for the label on the runway in March.\", 'No other than Staten Island’s Wu-Tang Clan were tasked with closing Tommy Hilfiger’s spring show this evening with a surprise performance. “It’s going to be fun, and it’ll definitely be a source of entertainment,” offered the designer earlier this week at a preview. Mission accomplished.Last season, Hilfiger returned to New York Fashion Week with a lavish runway presentation set at the famous Oyster Bar at Grand Central Station. The idea, he said then, was to jump back into the Fashion Week circuit keeping New York iconography in mind: Iconic city landmarks hosting an iconic New York label. Last night, the Empire State Building was lit up with Hilfiger’s signature colors. But that was just the teaser.The invitation to tonight’s show was a brass-toned coin. A quick Google search (and subsequent eBay rabbit hole) confirmed the suspicion that Hilfiger was offering his guests a Tommy-fied version of a Staten Island Ferry token, a now long-gone remnant of New York history since the city made riding the ferry free in 1997. And so we rendezvoused at the southernmost tip of Manhattan at the MV John F. Kennedy, a massive ship named after the late US President that operated as a Staten Island Ferry from 1965 until 2021. You may remember when, following her retirement, Staten Island natives and professional funny dudes Colin Jost and Pete Davidson purchased it at auction with the goal of turning it into a comedy and entertainment club. (Jost was at the show, Davidson was not.) The idea, said Hilfiger, was to find somewhere signature to the city that was also not a usual suspect: “That’s what we wanted, something iconic but a little unexpected.”Hilfiger’s collection straddled the line between both. There was classic Tommy: Navy captain’s blazers and peacoat-style trench coats, cricket sweaters and tennis v-necks, pleated khaki chinos and prim poplin dresses and shirt dresses. “We wanted to live within our brand codes: Stripes, red, white, and blue, nautical, and collegiate preppy,” said Hilfiger.But his fall show, beautiful and polished as it was, lacked some frisson. And so here there was some new-new: Button downs and slacks in crinkled fabrics, single-pleat trousers cut in lightweight denim, swishy loose-gauge sweaters hand knitted in either silk, cotton, or cashmere, and a run of slim-fitting capris in colorful checks. These had a hint of sexy that added some friction to the collection, albeit still within the Hilfiger vernacular: “It’s our way of being sexy, which is not the same as everyone else’s. Ours is all-American, I think,” said Hilfiger. Because of how classic they are at face value, Hilfiger’s clothes can sometimes carry a certain preciousness. This collection was at its best when it had a lived-in patina, when the styling was playful rather than matchy-matchy: the “unexpected” he referred to. That’s the right instinct moving forward.The MV JFK ship served for 55 years and completed approximately 200,000 journeys. It would be easy to lean into the parallel here—the MV and Hilfiger, two American classics in the advent of a new era. But here’s the thing about Hilfiger: He’s never stopped. Like the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, or a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich from the corner deli, Tommy Hilfiger is as much part of the city’s iconography as the ship that hosted his show. There’s only one way to become a beloved classic: show up and show out.', 'What do the medieval painting “The Ship of Fools” by Hieronymus Bosch and the Titanic—and even, one could argue, Fashion Week—have in common? For the London-based designer Torishéju Dumi, each, in its own era and context, reflects chaos. Between shipwrecks and these turbulent times, she had more than enough material to drawn on.“It’s almost like a decay of decadence; we’re all doing what we can to stay afloat. I think it would be dishonest if I just did a collection without reflecting on the world we live in right now,” the designer said backstage before a spring show that was made possible thanks to generous support from Diego Della Valle. She also received a boost from the Virgil Abloh Foundation, which supports diversity and inclusiveness in the creative industries.On the runway, the clothes illustrated what Dumi called “a thin charade of order.” Some pieces came together just days ago—the long white shirt dress in look 5 was one example. Others looked as time-intensive as couture. Among those were a sharply-cut cropped pink jacket, ample-shouldered tailcoats, microscopic skirts held aloft by layer upon layer of petticoats and worn with bloomers, and sheer black mesh numbers stuffed with offcuts from the studio. Those were a sartorial riff on failed lifejackets, but they stood out in a season rife with puffed-up clothes. Evening looks such as a long crinkled ivory gown, a black tank and skirt ensemble veiled in white, or bold red or yellow checks, could easily have walked right off that ship and into the gilded salons of Paris. The tempest-tossed pearls were a cute touch, too.If a sense of impending disaster inspired this show, what gave it buoyancy was a glimmer of hope. Dumi, a woman of deep faith, describes herself as a world-builder. “I have to believe that there is a better future,” she said. “Whenever you see beauty, there is always hope.”', \"Tory Burch transformed the atrium of the Domino Sugar Factory—Skylight at the Refinery is its official new name—into a pool, with walls and floor in aqua tiles. We were a dozen stories in the air and underwater at the same time, which is fitting because backstage Burch was talking about opposites: “power and grace, precision and freedom.” Maybe it was a case of Olympics fever—she said she was thinking about sport.This wasn't unfamiliar territory for Burch; she launched Tory Sport six years ago. Here, though, she was less focused on performance wear and more on aesthetics, from the shoes right on up. Across from the Vogue bench, Michelle Williams, Jodie Turner-Smith, Elizabeth Olsen, and other celebrities all wore fall 2024’s pierced pump (arriving in stores next month). This season’s shoe comes with a peep-toe and a sculptural “twisted” heel. No locker room flip-flops here.But that exception aside, there were many athletic elements at play. The most obvious were the tank bathing suits and the drawstring waist karate pants they were worn with. Other pieces made subtler reference to sport, like the jersey dresses with contrasting shoulder panels that called to mind American football, and the stretch wool gauze shirts with the vertical stripes of rest-of-the-world football jerseys.The most surprising pieces were the skirts with malleable wire waistbands, which arced out, rather than gripped the midsection—surprising because the waist is rarely an area that women want to add inches to. In contrast, the narrow flecked wool pants with full breaks over those peep toe pumps looked elegant with both shrunken quilted wool and silk jackets and traditional wrap jacket styles. The show closed with a trio of looks combining sleeveless muscle tees and softly draped and ruffled asymmetric jersey chiffon skirts that lived up to Burch’s “power and grace” concept.Athleticism and sports are a running theme this week. The gutsiest move on Burch’s part just might be the return of the Reva ballet flat, the shoe that launched her business into the stratosphere way back when but hasn’t been seen on the runway in some time. Can she make it a fashion shoe again? She’s giving it a try with peekaboo logo Ts at the toes. Bold.\", 'It’s a good day for Swedish fashion: Just hours after Ellen Hodakova Larsson was named the winner of the LVMH Prize in Paris, Elin Kling and Karl Lindman had their first New York City show. Toteme’s much-hyped debut was also a homecoming; the Swedish couple were living in the Big Apple when they founded the brand in 2014. Since then it has acquired a cult following and seems primed for exponential growth given the label’s increasing retail presence (they’ll open their second store in Manhattan this week), the popularity of quiet luxury, and the general Rowification of fashion. At 10, Toteme has become both a totem and beacon of minimalism.The brand is unyieldingly loyal to Kling’s own style. Nothing comes down the runway or goes into a store that it’s not possible to imagine Kling wearing—and so it has been from the beginning, when she was segueing from influencer to media mogul (Kling had her own magazine, StyleBy) to the designer/entrepreneur, style icon she is today. (Last summer a picture of Kling going to Bergdorf Goodman caused quite a stir among fans.) This fealty means that Toteme has a clear point of view; and for Kling it’s how you style pieces that brings newness. “The color palette is very black and white; that’s what I wear a lot myself. I like the play of how you bring fabrics together, how you can get this saturation from black suede, and then if you wear a black cotton trouser, you get a sort of washed effect. I feel like you don’t need [lots of] color if you don’t want to because you have texture,” she said.Kling has always been attracted to the Upper East Side, home of the Bergdorf Blonde (indeed the show was in a neighboring building to the store). Bringing Camilla Nickerson on as stylist was smart, her instinct for raw edginess and Kling’s restraint balanced well.  “We talked a lot about wellness,” Kling noted; tanks in the lightest of knits added a welcome sporty, if Helmut Langian touch. Softening the brand’s signature rigor was romance in the form of twisted tulle skirts, and even some unexpected floral embroidery. From tailored satin coats to draped goddess dresses, there was more emphasis on dress-up looks. (Michelle Williams—front-row in an LBD and a gold necklace that sat perfectly along the neckline, sheer black nylons and black slingback wedges—epitomized the ladylike aspect of the brand.)A totem is a monument, by definition a “representative of a particular quality or concept.” Toteme has become synonymous with minimalism, timelessness, and discipline, even if the spring silhouettes were described as “pacy” (meaning for busy, active women/New Yorkers) in the show notes. In its focus on good design at relatively accessible prices, Toteme is leaning into its Scandinavian roots, where how you live is connected to what you wear.', 'In February last year, Camille Perry and Holly Wright realized their considered vision for Tove, the label they founded in 2019, on the runway. Tove had already cultivated a loyal audience, who were magnetized by their elegant, yet slightly undone, proposition for womenswear––representative of a certain London spirit captured perfectly with their approach to silhouettes.\\xa0After a catwalk hiatus for fall––they instead showed via a look book––Tove was back on the schedule at London Fashion Week, returning to Senate House, where they made their debut. “It was about starting afresh,” said Wright of the early stages of the design process. “We looked at what felt new and exciting, what felt right at the time.” Perry added: “It was very much about building out the [the Tove woman’s] world: what do we feel like she needs? What are we not offering her?”At a preview, as the designers stood beside the lineup board and rails of the spring collection, surrounded by an all-female team in the studio, they talked about their “female gaze” and how it informs every decision they make. “There’s a lot of confidence that comes with that,” said Wright. Perry pulled out an intentionally creased, but still somewhat crisp shirt with silver buttons: “We always say the Tove woman should feel elevated; be the envy of women in the room.”\\xa0Conversation moved on to a Tipp-Ex white, coated-linen trench coat––which, at the show, was styled with tapered white trousers and a pair of their new mules––then a fishnet top covered in hand-sewn crystals. It was followed by super-fine, gauzy mesh long-sleeve tops, and a vanilla draped dress made from the same chiffon. On the subject of dresses (a Tove specialty), there were plenty of new-season options: two sultry black styles, one sheer on the top and one made from thin Italian jersey (flourished with the type of mini train that is actually feasible to wear to an event); a generous crinkled-linen style with a deep-cut, V neckline; and a sage silk maxi, to name but a few. Plays on print and texture, elements Perry and Wright push further with each collection, took form as tie-dye denim, stripes on tailoring, a criss-cross pattern on matching separates and a dress, and a fuzzy chiffon that looked feathered.Shoes made a well-received entrance for spring. Pointed-toe mules constructed from elasticated strands and supple leather lace-up sandals were fitting complements for the easy ready-to-wear. After a collaboration with fellow London talent Completedworks, Tove now counts own-brand jewelry in its offering––large ribbon earrings that are surprisingly lightweight, cuffs and sculptural pendants––in addition to slouchy totes with metal beads on ties at the edges.\\xa0Terms like minimalism and quiet luxury would be too broad for Tove’s style manifesto. “It all comes from a really personal place,” said Perry. And you can tell.', 'Elements of Lee Krasner’s 1970 Comet painting were printed on the panels that formed the centerpiece at Ulla Johnson’s show. The designer worked with the estate of the late artist for two years to secure permission to use it and two other pieces, Portrait in Green and Palingenesis, as prints in her new spring collection.Johnson feels an affinity for Krasner. They’re both New Yorkers, both children of immigrants, and both mad for flowers and nature. “She talked about wanting her work to breathe and live. That spoke to me so much,” Johnson explained. “Women walk these clothes into life; it’s not a garment, it becomes part of the wearer.” In the show notes, Mary Gabriel, author of Ninth Street Women, a book about female artists of late 20th century New York, took the idea a step further: “Lee Krasner is no longer something we look at, it’s something we live in.”The Krasner prints decorated everything from cotton sportswear separates to midi dresses in multiple silhouettes. There’s breadth and depth to Johnson’s categories, which is both a symbol of and a key to her achievement, and as of today, it appears that she’s adding a new one. A lace tunic worn with flared jeans and a Krasner print coat, among other pieces, were worn by male models. “These were not looks cut for men, they were cut as part of our ready-to-wear, but then the boys came in and they looked incredible; it felt so natural,” Johnson said. “I think this false binary between womenswear and menswear seems quite outdated, so maybe, yes, it’s the official launch of men’s.”Craft is always a focus for Johnson, and this season there were day and evening styles on offer, including a shredded yarn top and skirt set and a black party dress with swags of gold bead fringe. On the more utilitarian side, she showed two-tone patch pocket denim, coated canvas field jackets, and cotton capes that conjured vintage military nurse uniforms.Not to draw too oblique a parallel, but Krasner and Johnson share another similarity. The former was under-recognized in her life, working in the long shadow cast by her famous husband Jackson Pollock. The latter, for her part, doesn’t always get the credit she deserves for building one of New York’s biggest fashion businesses, without much in the way of support from the industry, at least at first. These days, though, Johnson’s success is unignorable.', \"For spring, Uma Wang said she wanted to focus on what remains after everything extraneous is stripped away. Her main inspiration, she added, was the recent retrospective on Constantin Brancuși at the Centre Pompidou.“I loved what he did with different materials, putting together stone, marble and mirrors,” Wang offered backstage before the show. “The exhibition was so incredible, I immediately wanted to transpose it and find that balance, but then also something different with the details,” she said. Her goal, she added, was to pare back and approach clothing as if it were a sculpture or birds floating on mirror ponds.The lighting in the American Cathedral threw draped effects, unusual fabric treatments and glinting mirror accessories into dramatic relief. Some prints, including a floral from Wang’s early archives, looked as if they had been plucked from a French herbarium, but the designer left backs bare to amp up sensuality. “Showing skin is more feminine,” she noted.Sculptural silhouettes appeared to reinterpret toga styles to dramatic effect, or to splice a New Look-style peplum, held aloft with burgundy tulle, with a sleek black evening sheath. Textural effects included shiny laminates, waxing and jacquards treated inside out, their threads teased into shags. “I want people to see how beautiful the back is, it’s like an art piece,” Wang said. “I like an element of surprise, of doing something a little bit wrong. If everything is correct, that’s just boring.” Also new to her repertoire was an earthy, cocoa palette that the designer deemed adaptable to all seasons.Seated in the front row, Suzi de Givenchy described Wang as the epitome of the modern Chinese woman. “She's fierce and strong and really embracing what she sees as beauty, which is something you don’t really see that often,” she said. “Uma’s reserved, but when she speaks you can really feel her power.” The clothes, too, spoke volumes.\", 'Hiding in plain sight. To enter Umit Benan’s laid-back mellow showroom, you had to go through an imposing steel door. Behind it, a getaway from Milan’s chaotic environment—warm, cozy furniture and a little nested courtyard full of greenery that gave way to a discovery of finely tailored garments that complemented the setting perfectly. “We are not quiet luxury,” the designer pointed out. “We have a California attitude visible in the silhouettes paired with an Italian product that’s synonymous with the highest quality.” The winds of change are blowing at Umit Benan; if previous seasons were inspired by precise characters—especially from Latin America—now luxury remains the true fil rouge, with less creativity involved and more bespoke approaches implemented.“I had completely lost the relationship with the client,” Benan explained of his new focus on building a wardrobe tailored to his shoppers. The relaxed fit remains a relevant trait, but it can now get customized to the wearer: Based on word-of-mouth marketing alone, this service now accounts for almost 60% of his business. That’s part of what brought the designer to open a retail space in the center of Milan, which he hopes to have up and running by next December. The shop will be divided into two different areas. One will be dedicated to selling the seasonal collection, while the other will be an appointment-only studio that will also include bar services and personal styling.Innovations at Umit Benan include an interest in denim too. “We tried to design a few jeans prototypes, but none of them completely convinced,” Benan revealed. “I am looking for a gap—whether it’s in washes or silhouettes—to be filled in the market.” There was a renewed approach to knitwear as well: By working with one of the five factories in Italy that do circular knitting, Benan introduced jersey characterized by fluidity and lightness without using elastane.With a color palette of predominantly tomato red and azzurro, inspired by the ’80s, these less saturated tints conveyed airiness and paired perfectly with the designer’s loose silhouettes. The addition of black and white created harmony, while he played with textures that conveyed brightness. Specifically, his use of mixed fibers, like linen mixed with silk or wool, or cotton mixed with silk, which were among the favorites in the collection.', 'Very refined bondage plus a vegan breakfast buffet made for a healthy start at this morning’s Undercover womenswear presentation. It was held at Dover Street Market Paris. We filed through the courtyard, past the chair avalanche installation by Tadashi Kawamata, and headed downstairs. Once there, we were greeted with a group of recognizably quotidian garments arranged on mannequins. There was a white hoodie worn with black leather leggings. A red knit polo shirt with matching five-pocket pants. A white T-shirt dress. A khaki cardigan. A white tailored blazer with a matching skirt. A biker jacket (naturally). And a long black tailored coatdress.You noticed that the lifeless figures were wearing the same lace collars and metal leaf or nail headpieces last seen at June’s menswear show. Some wore new accessories: gauze chokers embroidered with the words “Kosmik Witch.” Yet the most striking details lay within those aforementioned garments—banks of parallel golden zippers set in leather strips and linked by more leather lacing, or sections of metal-buckled strapping that contained and defined.Jun Takahashi was on hand, via translator, to outline. The translator summated: “The core of Undercover design is usually putting some of his unique taste into daily clothes…adding some fetishness and being able to adjust the size and the silhouette can make daily clothes sexier and also more elegant.” Punk is one of Takahashi’s foundational influences, and the worn mechanisms of restraint and control are key to that subculture’s fashion tradition. Here, he was applying them to some strikingly mainstream templates in order to make the safe suddenly, exhilaratingly dangerous.In the next room was that breakfast buffet, which was receiving a thorough review from early arrivals. Alongside it was a section of nonbondage outfits that used needle-punching to blur the gradient sections of washed color in the looks. These were more womenswear cousins to the menswear that had shown in June, in that they were based around artist Robert Bosisio’s nebulous dimensional canvases. Finally, we came to a room in which were arranged four dresses, in pink, white, black, and a lemon print on black. These had finlike frilled necklines and hems, between which ran silhouette-defining sections of more strapping or zippers and lacing. They were worn by lace-masked and metal-garlanded models who twirled effortlessly on rotating platforms: pretty and severe.The now-revived Undercover policy is to have one show a season and throw a presentation for whichever gender’s collection doesn’t make the runway that time round. Today’s format, especially with the designer present, was as stimulating to sample as the no-egg egg sandwich at the buffet. It was infinitely more interesting and engaging than having only the look book in hand. And it allowed for a final question: What is Takahashi’s daily fetish? The designer smiled under his hat, then delivered the answer to this one himself: “A secret!”', 'Well, that was sensational! After a two-year gap, Alessandro Michele was back on the runway today in Paris, the new man at Valentino. In his absence, fashion has fallen into a quiet luxury funk that we’ve all gotten so used to we didn’t realize quite how good his maximal, more-is-better vibes could make us feel. The mood was ecstatic as people left the show. This crowd is prone to hyperbole, but an overheard remark, “the king is back,” had a ring of truth to it.A consummate showman, Michele set out to do Valentino his way. After years of the brand showing at the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild in the 8th arrondissement, we were out on the Périphérique, where the Dojo de Paris presides over the side of the highway. It was an eyebrow-raising location for Valentino, a maison whose bon vivant founder is as famous for his grand homes (and yacht) as he is for ruffles and the color red.Michele had transformed the arena’s cavernous basement with love seats, chairs, and ottomans (along with some armoires and giant birdcages) shrouded in dust covers atop cracked-mirror flooring. We were perhaps in one of those stately houses, excavating its hidden treasures or raising ghosts—Michele loves a metaphor, both visual and literal. Ambient music echoed through the space as it filled with the designer’s friends including Elton John, Harry Styles, Florence Welch, Colman Domingo, and Maneskin’s Damiano David.Into this atmosphere, Michele sent out 85 looks—modest by the standards of the surprise resort collection he dropped online in June—as eccentric and extraordinary as anything he did for Gucci, but with a lightness, femininity, and exquisiteness of detail that can only be Valentino. In a meeting before the show, Michele said he was in the house’s archives before the end of his first day at the company. “It’s so alive; it’s a place with a lot of history,” he observed. “You can really find inside everything: the ’80s, ’70s, ’60s. For a guy like me who adores analyzing all this stuff, it’s a privilege.”He said he started by looking at pieces that impressed him aesthetically—“the very beautiful and light ruffles, the doll look that came from the ’60s and ’70s, and an ’80s power suit with a kind of sensuality that’s [actually] very démodé now.” If anybody can make the démodé modern, Michele can; after all, he did it once before, reshaping fashion and turning around Gucci’s fortunes with his inclusive gender-fluid vision for the brand.', 'A 10th anniversary can make even the most irreverent of designers turn contemplative. Vaquera’s Patric DiCaprio and Bryn Taubensee are on the precipice of that milestone and have been thinking about what comes next. “We’re still very punk in our roots,” said Taubensee, “but we’re asking ourselves, how can we also make it easy for people to understand and wear, and easy enough for us to survive?” DiCaprio put it more bluntly: “Shooting ourselves in the foot isn’t really where we see the future for our lives and this brand.”The challenges facing both emerging and established labels have been discussed ad infinitum this year in the face of contracting retail models and economic downturns. The designers gave us the sense that Vaquera hasn’t been immune to the difficulties that the label’s peers have experienced, but they’re charging forward anyway.Their idea for spring was to zero in on essentials. Backstage, they called them their “new basics,” pointing to a black bubble miniskirt with built-in bike shorts, bullet-bra tops (a surprise trend this season), and jersey tees with logos or other graphic treatments. Stretched around the arms, strapless bras gave button-downs a fetish-y vibe; without them, the shirts would make it in the straight world no problem, but is there any fun in that? In the end, these were not-that-basic basics, and that’s how their customers like it. DiCaprio and Taubensee have developed bankable signatures. A showgoer on the retail side reported that Vaquera consistently sells out on its e-commerce platform.But look closely and it seemed like they were also playing with other brands’ signatures. The interlocking V’s on denim jeans and canvas bags, the oversized gold-on-black chain prints, and the striped rugby with the winged Pegasus stamped on the chest reminded me of the kind of double takes they sent down their early runways. They’re no longer designing giant Tiffany & Co.–blue dust-bag dresses, as they did in their breakout collection for fall 2017, but their sense of subversion remains firmly in place. Only now that they’re growing up, they’ve got new categories on offer alongside it, including kitten-heel cowboy boots and pumps that rank up there with some of the coolest shoes of the season.', 'After looking to the 1960s in their recent resort collection, Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard hoped to bottle something a little more ephemeral for spring 2025: the It-Girl. “You can always envision that girl,” Swanson Beard says. “It’s all about her je ne sais quoi, her style, and how she puts things together. It’s this relaxed, luxe, casual vibe.”The Veronicas hoped to capture the It-Girl spirit in part through an extensive denim offering, from jorts to jackets. “Denim, for us, is a huge emphasis this season. [An It-Girl] always has this statement denim,” Swanson Beard said. Menswear-inspired slouchy suiting also takes center stage. (They’re hesitant to rely too much on their staple Dickey jacket, turning instead to heat-friendly options.) “We did a lot of short sleeve blazers, some pedal pusher suits, and vest suiting,” Miele Beard explained.The duo is firmly over quiet luxury, falling back on loud prints here. “Print is just so totally polarizing, very personal,” Swanson Beard said. After a spring 2024 collection of muted colors and minimal print (save for the occasional stripe), the designers didn’t hold back, exploring everything from navy and white leather pieced stripes to a floral charmeuse. Even their denim incorporates pattern; they tried out a denim eyelet shorts-and-jacket set, as well as laser-printed paisley jeans. “We have a print language that we always seem to go back to as a brand,” Miele Beard added. “You can pick it out.”While they acknowledge that prints aren’t for everyone, the duo are at their best when they ignore what’s trendy and embrace their personal tastes. The glittery multicolored striped knit set and the long-sleeve green charmeuse maxi dress with a pink floral pattern aren’t necessarily the pedal pushers and vests that some It-Girls are wearing today. But isn’t an It-Girl someone with an unwavering confidence in their style, regardless of what’s popular?', 'The spring 1997 Versus show was Donatella Versace’s starting point for spring 2025. It was fashion’s pre-internet pre-history when elevated runways were still commonplace, as were the photographers who lined up against them. Can you imagine the clamoring today, if front-row content makers couldn’t get their iPhone shots?Versus was Donatella’s baby, a diffusion collection she designed in her own image, while her older brother Gianni took care of the main line. At a press conference, she said she was drawn to spring ’97, which was shown in New York in October ’96, because “it was a joyful moment.” In the ’90s, “there was freedom, happiness, not too much thinking, and being more casual [about] putting your clothes together,” she explained.That long-ago season she really lived up to Versus’s latter-day billing, clashing prints and patterns in energizing ways. Fast forward 28 years to a Milan night just balmy enough for the outdoor setting of the Castello Sforzesco, and she was at it again, with squiggly patterned knits and floral prints, some on silk and some on chainmail, which were near replicas of the originals.Versace has been revisiting past collections, with varying degrees of specificity, since the 20th anniversary of her brother’s death in 2017. Fashion’s reissue phase has proved remarkably resilient. Ironically, it’s probably because the internet has helped make young people—or young fashion people, at least—so curious about the past. It’s all at your fingertips, and, with the right budget, in your closet.This collection did feel quite youthful by Versace standards, more sweet than sexy with its baby pastels, slip dress and cardigan combos, denim and short-shorts, not to mention the perfume bottle and champagne stem heels. On the other hand, there was a deft and subtle use of color that that old Versus show could never match, nicely exemplified by a man’s caramel-colored camp shirt and lavender trousers, and a woman’s copper tank and lilac skirt. A men’s leather jacket in soft yellow and white worn with violet colored leather pants was another highlight.One significant upgrade since 1997 is technology. What looked like a gold sequin strapless dress on Anok Yai was actually 3D-printed; apparently built without seams, its famous Versace hourglass shape was programmed by a machine. How cool would it be to see an entire Versace collection developed in that way? What kind of free-thinking would that experimentation open up?', 'Fans of Balenciaga, Barthes, or bathos were all well served by this evening’s entertaining enough Vetements installment. We were directed to a pigeon-infested corner of a Montparnasse mall that had the same heady odor Nicole Phelps described at the breakout Vetements show at Le Depot nearly a decade ago. This once underground brand might now be overground, but it maintains the appearance of sedition.Travis Scott opened the show in a lacquer-finish black moto look, the first of many moto pieces to roar past. Gigi Hadid wore a minidress version of the yellow duct tape catsuit worn by Kim Kardashian to watch a Balenciaga show a few seasons back: the other difference was that Hadid’s tape was stamped with the DHL logo. You can unwrap that for yourself: the Gvasalia saga rumbles on.And on. The collection bickered its way through multiple chapters of looks which echoed themes seen in past collections both here and at Balenciaga. In amongst all the self-referential fraternal trolling there were some cool enough things—and Carmen Kass’s pregnant runway walk was great to see—but watching this often felt like overhearing a one-sided argument.', \"By the time you read this, the vivid green draped dress that was cut like an embrace of curves and worn by Gigi Hadid to terrific effect in Victoria Beckham’s spring 2025 show will already be available to buy. It was made so immediately after the show ended. Heck, maybe you’ve already bought it! Immediacy has been part Beckham's arsenal as a designer. She understands what she wants to wear, and that has by extension been a very reliable barometer of what a ton of other women will want to wear too. Ever since she launched her label with her distinctive form-fitting dresses way back in 2008 she has taken the lead and seen plenty of others happily follow suit—or dress, for that matter.When it comes to spring, Hadid’s dress might have cleaved most closely to the origins of her label. But what’s been impressive about Beckham is that she doesn’t let the grass grow under her feet, or just let herself ever settle into the comfort groove. For spring, that intuition of hers was telling her to take more risks, push further, test the limits of what she can do—and very good it was too. This was, no pun intended, stretching what can be meant by body and conscious, and none of it typical or expected. “It’s all about silhouette and my obsession with silhouette,” she said of her spring collection at a preview the other day. “Each season we look at the brand codes, and how we can respect the brand codes, but challenge ourselves to explore new ways of expressing them.”Beckham indicated a table on which were some pieces in a gossamer light silk chiffon which had been dipped into a resin so it looked like they had been molded directly onto the body, sculpted close to the torso or floating skywards, before letting the fabric flutter off in the breeze. Each took several days to make. It was a technique which was ethereal and romantic, with the series of floating floral dresses emphasizing the delicacy of the fabric, but the molded fabric was also striking when used for a wet look top which had a bit of a tougher attitude. (And they weren’t just for show; Beckham mentioned they’d figured out a way to make something very similar available in the showroom.)\", '“Ask yourself if you’re ready to sleep,” a voice echoed from the courtyard of the Leonardo da Vinci Museum of Science and Technology. “Forever” by the Little Dippers started playing, and before attendees even realized it, we were inside Vivetta Ponti’s bedroom. “I imagine it to be pink and colorful, full of floral wallpapers fractured only by a window that looks outside,” the designer said, referring to her latest surreal element. “It is a symbol of appearance against reality,” she added.Starting from her love of interior design and tapestries, Ponti reinterpreted curated furnishings and romantic draperies. The most visible motif was a recurring side-folded pair of draped curtains, multiplying their shape via many different fabrics to give continuity to the collection. A signature floral print became the mold for clothes and accessories, lavished on light materials such as cotton and silk blends. Contrasting the femininity of fluid textiles, menswear touches completed Ponti’s vision: “She’s a business woman with naive details,” she said, pointing at pinstripes and men’s suit linings against baby collars and laces.Sleepwear emerged loudly at first glance. Pillows were transformed into light blue moiré tops and bags paired with Bermuda shorts, but the wardrobe became a whole when seen up close: It was all in the details. Transparencies, conveyed by tridimensional organza dramatic dresses, were borrowed from curtains once again, just like fringes adorning mini skirts. Moreover, a lily-of-the-valley flower embroidery morphed into its macro version on collars, shaping the hems of piqué shirts too, moving away from Ponti’s former fascination with roses. “I grew up in a household where perfumes were constantly drenching the air,” she recalled.Patchworking was the preferred logic for accessories, with Lady Diana–inspired choker and pendant earrings worn upside down. Glass-pearl assemblies re-created tops and belts, while Vivetta’s iconic hand collar was reimagined with red stiletto nails. The ongoing collaboration with Rosantica gave birth to a house-shaped bag set with 2,500 colored crystals that stood out, featuring miniature windows, blossoming flowers and the designer’s cats. Bedroom slippers inspired ribboned kitten heels; square-toed loafers completed the wardrobe.“My designs are meant for everyone,” said Ponti. “I imagine many different ages and personalities inhabiting my clothes.” In the showroom a few days ahead of the runway show, her mother was wearing Vivetta’s collections; on the day of the show, kids paraded hand-in-hand with models dressed a “mini me” defined version of Ponti’s designs: For the first time, Vivetta unveiled a children’s collection.', 'Let other designers talk about elevating their offerings; ascension was the name of the game at Who Decides War. By this Ev Bravado and Téla D’Amore meant upping the quality of their work (they produced in house rather than relying on contractors) and expanding their range. The angels and wings that adorned the invitation suggested a spiritual reading of\\xa0 the term. And it so happened that the designers showed in the Hall des Lumières, a former bank, where models climbed a steep flight of stairs to emerge onto the catwalk where they paraded to a soundscape by Cash Cobain with live accompaniment from a student orchestra. In the front row were seated rappers with millions of followers outfitted in WDW.\\xa0 That a brand presenting its 10th collection could have such pull is impressive.\\xa0The past few months have been particularly busy for the designers, and after their collaboration with H&M and the Jean-Michel Basquiat estate launched this summer, said D’Amore, “We went to Bordeaux and just locked ourselves up in a huge castle.” The grandeur of the surroundings set the direction of the collection. “The inspiration is the Victorian age,” said Bravado at a preview. “It’s really Victorian power dressing through our lens, through Americana codes; saying in a sense, ‘You don’t need to be from Europe to do it, you can do it here.’”\\xa0\\xa0There are few things more American than jeans, a signature of the brand. Bravado explained that the commercial collection had been shown prior to the show, allowing he and D’Amore to spread their wings. Yet the pieces that Bravado was talking about felt artful rather than commercial and they were what people in the audience were wearing. More of a mix between the collections on the runway might have been interesting. The designers didn’t abandon their signature techniques, however. Alton Mason opened the proceedings in a dreamy sweater made of upcycled knits and lace which was paired with beautifully tailored pants in what looked like crepe fabric. Adding poetry to a military-inspired vest were long trailing webbing ties that looked like ribbon; adding romance to the pants it was shown with were a Victoriana ruff and draped swag. Ruffles appeared on the shoulders of a Byronic shirt; they looked a bit like wings on a pearl-colored jacket for women.', 'Jackson Wiederhoeft is always generous with his ideas. At his shows, notes left on the seats carefully detail the inspiration for each season and have even been known to provide reading recommendations. This season there was nothing. “It’s funny because the collection is actually called Manifesto,” the designer said backstage after the show. “I had spent all summer writing a manifesto because this is our five-year anniversary and I wanted to make a statement about who we are as a brand.” In the end he decided to let the clothes do the talking, and boy, did they have things to say.The show opened with the sounds of the Kauaʻi ʻōʻō, a bird that went extinct in 1987. “This is the mating call of that bird, who lived for two years singing his song, not knowing that he was the only one,” Wiederhoeft explained. A dancer had been sitting center stage while guests walked in, and she stood up to reveal a white tulle gown embellished with mother-of-pearl seashells that played their own songs as she moved around the room, knocking about four other dancers dressed in black.Interestingly, Wiederhoeft was not planning on doing a show this season; instead he intended to introduce what he called his “corset program,” a ready-to-wear version of his popular Wasp corset. It consists of 68 sizes (yes, you read that correctly)—from 00 to 30, which also come in four subsizes each that take into consideration height, torso, body type, and cup size. Then sponsorship stepped in. “IMG approached us about a partnership with Capital One and Michelin for doing a show, so the runway ended up being the add-on this season,” he said. Immediately following the show there was a dinner with food from the queer-owned Michelin-recommended restaurant HAGS on the Lower East Side.Possibly because Wiederhoeft wasn’t planning on doing a show this season, and possibly because he is once again a finalist for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, his spring lineup was an encapsulation of his body of work so far—not a greatest hits but more a reaffirmation of what the brand does best. Corsetry certainly dominated, and his “sweatsuit” corset, covered in heathered gray jersey and worn over a ribbed tank top with rosette detail, and low-slung, wide-leg “sweatpants” with a faux-layered boxer short waistband were highlights. Elsewhere, a short-sleeve mid-length dress was printed with a blown-up photograph of a fence’s shadow reflected onto concrete, and a chocolate-brown dress with contrasting white broderie anglaise trim had an all-over plasticized look (even the lace). A white jacquard suit with black lace appliqué and a skirt made from jacquard until mid-thigh, then black lace to the ground, was Wiederhoeft to a T: very ladylike and totally unexpected.After the last model exited the runway, 26 women in matching white corsets and satin mermaid skirts, their faces covered in veils, came out. Some were tall, others short; some were curvy, some had very straight bodies. None of them were wearing the same corset size. This was our introduction to Wiederhoeft’s new corset program. “I really wanted it to be about the body—in my natural sense. I mean, you’re manipulating the body, but you know the performers who are wearing it for the first time, they’re like, ‘I can’t believe this is me!’” he said. “With this unembellished corset and white satin skirt, it’s like, ‘I have nothing to hide.’”', 'Willy Chavarría took us to Wall street for his spring 2025 runway show. “It makes sense,” you might think, seeing that he had titled his collection América… but look closer, see that accent on the e? This show wasn’t about that America, but rather our América.Inside the cavernous show space hung the American flag, dramatically lit by spotlights. Out came the Urban Sierreño musical group Yahritza y Su Esencia, led by Yahritza Martinez, a teenager who first found acclaim on TikTok. Accompanied by a trio of mariachis, she began singing “Querida,” an iconic heartbreak anthem by one of Mexico and Latin America’s most beloved singers Juan Gabriel. In the song, he wishes for a lover to return—“Every moment of my life / I think of you more each day / Look at my loneliness / It doesn’t suit me well at all.” Within the context of the show it seemed like a plea for América to be more like the promised land everyone imagines it to be.The models walked out, in a single file, at breakneck speed, like they all had somewhere to be. What came across was a voluminous yet exact silhouette that was a callback to the uniforms of the American working class—hotel workers, concierges, construction people, foremen. And so there were balloon sleeves on classic zip-up jackets, tonal shirt and tie combos, crisp white short sleeve button-down shirts, cotton duck work fabric turned into tailored Victorian jackets with princess sleeves or baggy cargo skirts, and really good denim pieces in both classic blue and a wonderful distressed shade of mustard-y brown. Many of the looks were accessorized with a set of keys—and a little crucifix—dangling from a belt loop.“The inspiration was coming from movements like the United Farm Workers Movement, and thinking of those things along with the fact that we’re in a presidential election period,” Chavarría said. It was an especially powerful moment in the show when a group of models came out with accessories that nodded to the uniforms of farm laborers—wide brim straw hats, bandanas wrapped around their faces—flanked by the American flag in the background.In the last three seasons Chavarría has focused on showing his take on capital-M menswear, with formal collections full of exquisite tailoring, but this season’s showcase of quotidian style was no less regal and elevated. He simply has the range.After the last model walked, the music changed. Surprise! Chavarría is collaborating with Adidas on a collection of ready-to-wear and sneakers inspired by the “Jabbar” style, created for Kareem Abdul Jabbar in 1978—the first sneaker ever created with an athlete—which is being re-released next year. Chavarría transformed the Jabbar into a pointy-toe style that is sure to be thee fashion sneaker of the season, and the athlete’s name also featured on a number of garments, though there was also a jersey in red, green, black, and white, emblazoned with the word CHICANO across the chest. Other standouts included ruffled track jackets in the same Victorian silhouette as the ones presented in his main collection, worn with matching shorts in acid neon shades. Noah Lyles, the American track star who won both gold and bronze medals at the most recent Olympics closed the show in a pair of tiny track shorts and a big dose of attitude. “This [season] is all about power to the people,” Chavarría said. “It’s this country through the voice of the immigrants, and the people who make this motherfucker run.”', 'In this most political of years, affairs of state were a topic largely left untouched by fashion this season. Not so at Lamine Badian Kouyaté’s Xuly.Bët show, held, as it was last time, in a passage in the Sentier, once home to the Parisian textile industry. The collection was akin to the one that preceded it, with an emphasis on printed denim. Spring’s offering was significantly larger, however, and covered all of the designer’s bases: reworked sports jerseys, wax print separates, parkas, and, of course, body loving, red-seamed stretch pieces.Viewers were offered a hint that things were the same but different from the get-go when model Kadra Omar appeared carrying a boombox. “She used to walk for me in the ’90s and she still has that magic to lead and bring joy to the entire crew,” the designer wrote in a post-show communication. “I wanted to bring her back for her spirit of gathering and also to mix the different generations, which is the purpose of the casting.” Xuly.Bët is a family affair; this season, the designer’s niece Amissa was working behind the scenes. At a walkthrough, she shared a story from her mother who went to school with Kouyaté and remembered that he had “a completely different style from everyone else; that he would cut off his school bags and then put them on the side in a way that people had never seen before.”Regarding the boomboxes, this editor thought that they referenced the designer’s iconic White show of 1993, in which he had models walking in the Tuileries outside of the Chanel show, each carrying her own sound system. But no. “The symbolism of the boomboxes is to bring back a sense of sharing and gathering and having fun together,” Kouyaté explained. “Nowadays everyone has their own earphones, which could be a major source of isolation and solitude for the new generations. Let’s have fun and overcome anguish.”Kouyaté has never been a designer who lives in a bubble; rather, he’s inspired by and engaged in what’s happening on the street and in the wider world. The bright white and blue garments in the collection are made using protest banners from UNSA, a union supporting public education. No matter the season, the overarching message at this brand is look good, do good.', 'Nowadays New York’s hottest club is the West Side Highway, where people go for early-morning jogs before heading to work. (Lately, it’s become the backdrop of the zeitgeisty romance-driven running clubs where 20-something singles search for a similarly athletic mate IRL.) Designer Yigal Azrouël—who has long hit the popular spot as a solo runner—took inspiration from his runs for his spring 2025 collection, with racerbacks, leather logo baseball caps, and cashmere jerseys among his offering. “I love mixing things together, playing with soft and hard, sporty and traditional, classic dresses, and clashing them together,” he said.Azrouël stuck by his house codes: Masculine-meets-feminine silhouettes, utilitarian details, and materials like leather and Japanese denim were all present. But it’s a tall order to include such heavy fabrics in a collection designed for the warmer months. While both denim and leather were present, the designer exercised his creativity to incorporate them into the collection in less literal ways. Denim trompe l’oeil was a recurrent motif, with Azrouël engineering an ultralight cotton-twill trench that made for a smart and convincing denim alternative. Less realistic was the silk overprinted blouse made to look like light wash. Still, Azrouël is a thoughtful designer. “You cannot really wear a heavy denim shirt in the summer, so I created it in a silk,” he said. “I love to experiment but keep it in a very minimal approach.”Still, the collection had many of Azrouël’s staples, which are his strongest pieces: heavy Japanese denim paper-bag pants and sexy, draped silk dresses with hardware embellishments. But he managed to strike a balance, like adding a raw hem and carpenter details to his pants or including a removable hood on a slinky dress. Experimentation with restraint is where he shines.', 'It might be tempting to read a kind of mad romance from this collection. Exceptional manipulations of fabrics—knotted at the bust or below the hips, placed as though torn, assembled in strips, pieced back together—possibly conjured a woman reconstructing a new version of herself from whatever materials she had left around her. The buckled straps dangling extra-long; unreadable words scrawled down leggings; jagged edges jutting out from skirts. The sharp-winged, smoky shadow encircling only one eye and partial lace veils. This show contained the duality of fragility and empowerment that other designers have been exploring this season.“Very dreamy but also quite dark,” was how renowned pianist Pavel Kolesnikov described the sorrowful-to-sentimental arrangement of Bach, Gluck, Ravel and Japanese compositions that he played live at the edge of the runway until the last section of the show that was accompanied by a recording of Yamamoto sampling Leonard Cohen’s You Want It Darker. “Vilified, crucified, in the human frame / A million candles burning for the help that never came…”Where was Yohji Yamamoto taking us this season? Not shuffling off this mortal coil, apparently. He attributed these “broken outfits” to a more naïve source. “Kids, they made it!” he said, smiling and especially upbeat. So then the intention was playful? “Playful, maybe, but it was very hard to play.”And this was certainly something other than child’s play. Not only did the looks burst forth with different foiled, felted, and floaty textures, they also did not adhere to any conventional notions of construction. Yet the models nestled their hands within cutout bits and were unencumbered by the twisting cords and extended volumes (reimagined hoop skirts, similar to those at Loewe earlier today, channeled the past as envisioned by the future). One standout dress in white lace layered with a dark gauzy pinstripe that extended from a portrait collar to a sweeping train was positively grown-up and gorgeous.By now, we know that contradictory impulses and expressions are inherent to Yamamoto’s body of work. This is how monochromatic, blobby shapes loosely tacked onto a dress can somehow appear sophisticated, or how swirls of denim and jacquard looked simultaneously opulent and arte povera. Interestingly, the vast variety of fabrics made me think that they had come from years and years of previous collections. Yamamoto’s reply, “Very good and bad question. We made them.”At this point in his career and his life, and with a yet another book (in collaboration with M/M Paris) debuting Sunday, Yamamoto is still finding ways to challenge himself. It was Picasso who famously said, “It took me four years to paint like Raphael and a lifetime to draw like a child.” The beauty of this collection was that the complexity and intuition came through in equal measure.A series of loosely constructed looks in an arresting shade of red brought the show to a somewhat blunt close, almost like a statement unspoken. For architect Jean Nouvel, the collection summoned the kind of beauty that was “at once sober and styled.” The interpretation of a Yamamoto show might always hover in the realm of the subjective. But the admiration—based on the overwhelming applause as the designer took an extended bow with Kolesnikov—well, that is collective.', 'Boxing topped Yuhan Wang’s bill as the heavyweight sporting inspiration for this show. Her press release spelled out pioneering female fighters including Jane Couch, Laila Ali (daughter of Muhammad), and Bridgett Riley as personifications of the spirit she was attempting to distill in her clothes. As the designer put it: “I think the past sportswear was all based on men. It’s quite functional, but no one’s thinking about how women want to be dressed in that kind of sportswear. Since we are quite good at lace, romantic moods, we are trying to express sportswear in a more feminine way.”This was further laid out via the head guard and silk boxing gloves clad in lace, and to a lesser extent the layered-waistband boxer shirts in shirting cottons. The notion of bringing ultrafeminine tropes into a sporting arena that until not so long ago was formally forbidden to women was a clever way of generating an interesting tension for Wang to explore.However, that headline sporting reference proved only one in a whirlwind combination of them. Football shoulder pads, basketball jerseys, soccer shin pads, tennis sweatbands, baseball shirts, and court shoe-sneaker hybrids were also thrown into the mix. Then there were the full tiered skirts, sometimes panniered, that were a tribute to a group of female wrestlers from La Paz, Bolivia, named the Fighting Cholitas. En masse these served to dilute the impact of the dichotomy that Wang had initially set up so nicely. Still, it was fun to sit runway ringside and follow Wang’s bout between the gendered codes of recreational protection and provocation.', 'You might call her Kim Gordon, but Henry Zankov would likely prefer goddess. (So would I, tbh.) Zankov went to see Gordon’s band Sonic Youth this past summer—green with envy here, I cannot lie—and he was transported back to the 1990s and to an era of alternative and grunge rock that has remained profoundly evocative to him. Let Proust have his madeleines, Zankov has Sonic Youth’s Washing Machine to get nostalgic about. “I was in high school and college listening to Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins,” said Zankov. “I’d moved to America from Russia, and American culture was confusing to me. I didn’t understand it. But somehow, through that music, I found my voice.”For next spring Zankov is certainly speaking loud and clear. He served up a fantastic mix of cropped sequin cardigans; slacker-ish board shorts; slouchy, trailing check pants; long, sinuous tubular skirts and tank dresses; and, boldly striped beachy sarong wraps which can be worn as skirts, dresses, or majorly big wrap and then just keep wrapping scarves. All of this was finished off with flip-flops, flat thong sandals, jewelry from current CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist Presley Oldham, and some very, very Kurt Cobain-esque white framed shades by Selima Optique.The ’90s and the music it produced has been one of the most revered—and revisited—eras by fashion, and for good reason; it was a sonic and style mashup of look, attitude, hipness, and a revolt against the status quo that was blindingly brilliant. We all know the names of the designers it inspired (hello, Mr. Jacobs) and the fashion revolution it provided the soundtrack to (enter Kate Moss, Corinne Day, Juergen Teller, Melanie Ward, et al). You can revisit it any day now by watching our very own about to be released documentary series In Vogue: The 90s.Except, in Zankov’s case, it wasn’t a literal ’90s re-tread that he was after, or interested in. Instead, and perhaps unsurprisingly for a designer primarily creating textured sweater dressing, it was the feeling of that time, and the emotional resonance it has for him, that he wanted to capture. “It was a magical, rebellious moment for me,” he said. “And I wanted to push the visual language of Zankov a bit further, still focusing on stripes and pattern and color, but really trying new techniques.” That he can intuit a freshly inventive and nuanced take on those years says much about his talent as a designer. It’s all down to two things.', 'The New York fashion shows can sometimes seem like a trend-a-thon, with some young and emerging designers rushing to imitate the previous season’s runway hits from Paris and Milan, or fixating on shapes that are better off left in the past. Not so for industry veteran Maria Cornejo. She’s been in business for over 25 years, but from the start she’s known herself and been true.For spring 2025, Cornejo presented a tight collection showcasing her signature geometric cuts and flair for offbeat prints. A skirt with a soft diamond silhouette that’s long been a best-seller has been transformed into a dress, and she brought back a graphic navy and black motif from the archives (eagle eyed observers will remember then-first lady Michelle Obama in the pattern circa 2009) for a matching tunic and pant set.There’s an appealing airiness to the collection. Cornejo’s clothes make a strong statement, but they wear lightly. No straining against corsets here, corsets being one of the peculiar (some might say problematic) affectations from the past being revived by the up-and-comer set. Her long experience wearing her own clothes has taught her much about the appeal of, say, an elastic waist pant or a dramatic, voluminous two-piece evening look that can be split apart for versatility.As ever, she’s focused on responsibly sourced fabrics. She pointed out the natural, cream color of her denim separates, explaining she won’t use white denim because it requires bleach to produce. That doesn’t mean her materials are dull or uninteresting. The most striking this season is “lotus coupé,” a teal and black floral jacquard with a subtle wow factor.', 'Despite the murky currents and prevailing winds buffeting luxury right now, Zimmermann is riding a wave. A new Soho store just opened in New York, and 14 more outposts will follow before the end of next year. During our preview, Nicky Zimmermann said the latest ETA on the house’s Paris studio is six months: “It’s going to be amazing. We’re going to have a full atelier so I’m going to be working between Australia and here, which is pretty incredible.”This show tried to lessen that distance. As they entered the Palais de Tokyo space, the audience was shown snippets from a 1970s Aussie surf movie named Morning of the Earth. Its sun-drenched footage (which can be seen in a remastered trailer on YouTube) showed boy and girl surfers shaping boards and raising chooks and carving waves in Australia and Indonesia. Zimmermann said she’d been in touch with its Bellingen-based director, Albert “Albe” Falzon, both to secure permission and to discuss the collection. “He’s unreal,” she said: “a gorgeous man. And we had the same vision of the light in Australia, and what it does to colors. I was trying to explain how I wanted to bring that through, and reflect the movement of surfing in the flow of the clothing, and use fabrics that looked like liquid.”Zimmermann’s opening look set the tone: a dress in marine blue organza with a braided macramé bodice from which flowed sets of wave like ruffles. There was a series of core day pieces, cropped trenches and strappy utility shorts and shirt dresses in soft and springy viscose drill that would return in various fabrications as we progressed. There was an Aloha print that showed kangaroos amongst the palms. A skirt and a crinolined dress in organdy shot with fine-filament metal at looks 40 and 41 really did share the same blissful shine of sun bouncing off ocean.The theme helped Zimmermann and her team develop some really interesting propositions. Jersey dresses in bronze were built around sections of wetsuit-sturdy neoprene that provided both stability and a platform from which the fabric could flow. Little details, like a pair of super-light cotton corduroy trousers or the shell and carved dolphin necklaces, were satisfyingly consistent with old school, lo-fi surf culture. Bags included fringed rattan baskets and a slouchy mid-sized leather one whose strap was set against hardware shaped to resemble a rack of boards. A cropped smock top in what looked like raw linen voile was edged with wavelets and embroidered with a sunray-surrounded yin and yang mandala design. Neither too literally surf nor too literally 1970s, this collection adapted the Eden-like spirit Falzon captured in his movie, then demonstrated how appealingly it sits adjacent to the Zimmermann ethos of joyful and fun self-expression through clothes.', 'In a recent interview, Rosalía declared Zoe Whalen one of her favorite up-and-coming designers. It’s easy to see why: Whalen’s clothes are living sculptures. She’ll mold papier-mâché around the body and swirl padded fabrics around its curves; she’ll wrap it in felted wool and sheer upcycled T-shirts and denims that flatter its silhouette and hug every inch. But they are still clothes.Whalen has been a compelling talent to watch rise in New York since her very first show back in February of 2023. This is a designer determined to keep the integrity of her art-cum-fashion-practice, and she’s done just that up to this point. Except that Whalen is also ready to level up. “I’m trying to create a structure for a business operation and think about how I can sustain myself with this,” she said. “I still create everything in my studio with a very small team, but these are things I can actually produce now.”Which brings us to Wednesday night, when Whalen hosted a dinner meets art performance meets fashion show at the Tiwa Select gallery space downtown. It was an intimate affair—actually intimate, around 45 people—where a cast of characters from the designer’s life wore pieces from her new collection as they cooked dinner and served each other and the rest of the guests. Whalen herself wore a charming hand-knit crop top with überlong scalloped sleeves paired with a tiered skirt (Look 23 in this gallery) as she served handfuls of arugula around the long candlelit table. “It’s a deconstructed salad,” she joked, poking fun at her own design vernacular.A few of Whalen’s pieces also hung in the space. One was a melting papier-mâché dress, the closing look here, which she said was the result of her experimenting with the material to make her own dress forms. There was also a run of her signature tiered panniers and the wooden clogs she’s been working to make wearable and comfortable. “The panniers are hand knit, but they’re not just an art piece,” she explained. “They can be produced. The art pieces I made for the context of the exhibition.”Whalen made beautiful ethereal dresses out of gathered laces, doilies, and lightweight silks and cut ribbed tank tops in the shape of corsets, paired with extra-wide jeans she treated to look aged and slightly disheveled. She also introduced accessories in the shape of a fanny pack, a kind of ergonomic design made to hug one’s abdomen curving down from the shoulder.Each course at the dinner was paired with a performance. The main dish featured Whalen molding a papier-mâché bodice around a model wearing one of her diaphanous dresses, the result resembling Look 1 in this look book; the dessert course, a jam-based concoction, led to a performer dyeing one of Whalen’s white corset dresses; and the grand finale saw each guest who had been wearing a piece walk atop the table to show off their look. “The hope was to create a space of tranquility within or right at the end of Fashion Week,” said the designer.For the last few seasons, when talking about her shows as interventions, Whalen has displayed a certain angst. Perhaps it was an excitement to get things going or a desire to be understood. Either way, that semblance of anxiety seemed to have been replaced by a sense of stillness. Whalen is still eager for more, but Wednesday’s dinner satiated her hunger.', 'In a season already defined by flowers, Zomer took the concept one step further by collaborating with an actual florist. Or make that “floral artists” Debeaulieu, the creators of phenomenal bouquets sent to top editors, A-listers and clients particularly during the collections.Backstage before the show, designer Danial Aitouganov was hard-pressed to pick a favorite bloom, noting that he is partial to bouquets of all kinds, while co-founder Imruh Asha is a lotus guy himself.“We had this idea of how the Zomer garden would look,” Aitouganov offered. With that idea, he went back to the studio and began growing the idea by toying with abstraction, treatments and literal interpretations. The collaboration with Debeaulieu, for example, yielded a couple of showpiece compositions—one made of real blooms, the other of artificial flowers dipped in chrome, a sculpture by Isabel + Helen.On the runway, the clothes really popped. Bright blooms were abstracted as whorls of satin, noodles of fluorescent mesh fringe with pearly beads inside, 3D posies with caviar beading, a poppy umbrella, gatherings of fabric around negative space, patches veiled by overlay, wrinkled neoprene wools, cashmere, silks, organza and printed Ecco leather (on peplum skirts) and a mashup of feather and sequin embroidery on a skirt. Certainly, some of the placements were straight-up saucy, but it was all in good fun. Accessories—limited edition leather bowling sneakers produced in collaboration the Finnish heritage brand Karhu, jewelry by Panconesi—looked covetable too.Meanwhile, in recent months Aitouganov left his day job in the menswear department at Louis Vuitton to dedicate himself fully to Zomer. It showed. On the soundtrack, a runaway train seemed to bear down faster and faster. Its implicit meaning was lost on no-one. The only thing left to do is buckle up and enjoy the ride.', 'The sea is shaping up to be one of spring’s major currents. In Zuhair Murad’s hands, it transforms women into the handmaidens of Venus, served up on the half-shell.Part human and part anemone, these demi-goddesses emerge clad in flowing jersey, cady, or English eyelet. Elements swept from the deep pop up in starfish embroideries or incrustations of shells and baroque pearls, for example on an easy black top with fluid pants. A wisp of a white handkerchief halter came in eyelet, while a series of poplin bralettes and voluminous dresses featured a lovely Italianate print. A black gown with rococo embroideries looked like a keeper; elsewhere, precious-looking beaded, sequined trim suggested a sailor’s rope and hammered satin was worked to resemble the movement and sheen of water. Geometric sequins eddied over a gray halter dress, a shift spliced by cut-outs, or a youthful white two-piece ensemble with a crop top and long skirt. Lacy cord embroidery anchored by stylized initials caught the graceful drift of algae. Several of the more pared-back ideas here will likely prove timeless.The designer also has been leaning into sharp tailoring of late, and here he showed admirable restraint by keeping the embellishments to negative space, as on a blush suit or a series in black. But if it’s a game of transparency his ladies are after, he’s got them covered, too, in black or white lace, at times with corsetry details, or (more modestly) strategically placed swaths inserted into breezy silk satin numbers.Murad’s ladies always dress to shine, but especially so by night, on the red carpet, at weddings, and wherever else they may alight. Here, he offered up draped, pleated, and lamé goddess dresses in a lush and universally flattering palette from champagne to caviar, with lashings of sunrise/sunset hues like apricot, coral, russet, silver, and bronze.', 'Stepping into 16Arlington’s show venue today in London—an airy, light-filled hall in the Royal Academy of Arts—a warning sign offered a whisper of what was to come. “Please be mindful,” it read. “Loose confetti underfoot.”The dog days of summer may have drawn to a close, but the weather in London this week has remained balmy—perfect timing, then, for Marco Capaldo to unveil a breezy, sun-kissed collection to keep the party going well into September. (Or, if we’re being technical, spring 2025.) There were sheer tees knotted at the bust, as if the wearer were lounging on a Balearic beach, paired with python-print knickers; bikini tops worn with diaphanous skirts that erupted with fiery dip-dyed marabou feathers; boyfriend button-downs thrown on over bralettes or barely there knit tanks. There was plenty of that confetti we were warned about covering the floor, plus a series of towering sculptures by artist Jesse Pollock of swaying palm trees rendered in steel and aluminum. As Edie Campbell stepped out under a milky yellow glow in the first look of a delicious suede duster coat, Jesus Loves You’s club anthem, “Generations of Love,” began to boom over the speakers.As always with Capaldo, though, it wasn’t just about fun in the sun—that frolicsome spirit was undercut by something a little twisted, even perverse. Inspiration struck after he watched Pedro Almódovar’s 2011 psychological thriller, The Skin I Live In, in which Antonio Banderas plays a plastic surgeon conducting illegal experiments on humans he keeps captive—a movie as macabre as it is stylish. “I was really studying the hues of the film’s lighting—those yellows and those steely blue-grays and those hints of eau de Nil,” Capaldo said at a preview. What kept drawing him back into Almódovar’s world, however, were the carefully curated artworks that hang in the plastic surgeon’s home, whether a striking replica of Titian’s Venus of Urbino or roughly hewn figurative sculptures inspired by Louise Bourgeois. “I could taste the scenes; I could smell the scenes; I could almost touch the scenes and know what they felt like,” Capaldo continued. “That was a sentiment I wanted to carry through in building this collection.”Capaldo may be unafraid to tackle edgier subject matter—just take last season’s collection, which explored the role of monsters in popular culture—but he’s always searching for the beauty within it. As he said, quoting a line from the film that was originally uttered by Bourgeois: “Art is a guarantee of sanity.” And there was a method to Capaldo’s apparent madness. First, in how well he knows his customer. The front row of 16A acolytes was practically cooing with delight at every look, and as always, Capaldo spoke about the women who surround him and inform his collection with wide-eyed reverence. “The woman, this season, is seen in this really special light,” he said. “It could be dusk, it could be dawn. She could be arriving or she could be leaving, but she’s always under the most magical light.” Second, there was the impressive craftsmanship on display, from the waxed raffia technique Capaldo developed to offer a new twist on his signature feathered embellishments, to the draped denim, to the series of gorgeous couture-level minidresses and skirts—we’re talking 57,000 hand-crocheted beads here—imprinted with silhouettes of lilies.Finally, and arguably most important, the show served as confirmation of the strength of the brand Capaldo has built. While the past few seasons have seen him lean sophisticated, developing a more grown-up wardrobe for his rapidly expanding customer base, in a sense this collection felt like a well-timed return to his party-girl roots—just revisiting that girl now that she’s all grown up. “She doesn’t need to be the loudest person in the room, because she just is, naturally, through her confidence,” Capaldo said. “Excuse the pun, but she’s comfortable within the skin she lives in.”', 'Phillip Lim’s show was a celebration of his 20 years in business. Looking around the room, just a small fraction of us were there for his start. Fashion is a notoriously challenging industry based on change. Most of Lim’s contemporaries from his mid-2000s beginnings have quietly slipped off of Vogue Runway’s review grid, victims of financial difficulties, too few ideas, or some other random problem. How does it feel to be one of the survivors? Backstage Lim used one word: joyful.The secret to Lim’s success is his eye for changing trends and his ability to incorporate them into his own brand vocabulary—his adaptability, you could say. So it was somewhat surprising to learn, on being told that he had used the color of the moment, that he was unfamiliar with the phenomenon of brat green. “It’s a color I wore in California when I was young,” he said by way of explanation. In any case, it appeared on a cool pair of loose-fitting jeans with zips down the sides that could get a girl out of her true blues.His vocabulary is strong. I recognized the rosettes from a spring 2007 collection, his first-ever runway show way back when. Other callbacks included lace tops with football jersey proportions, the crystal fringe numbers, and all the hybrids, like denim spliced with sweats and patched with camouflage, and “mantra” T-shirts that morphed into slip dresses. But Lim also tried new things, like taking up the length of skirts for a couple of micro wrap skirts and an acid-washed denim mini.Pressed for feelings about the milestone, Lim offered up words that felt rather like something he could print on one of those tees: “It feels like I can only guarantee the moment.” Fashion, he said, “comes and goes; lengths, colors change. But joy is a human quality we can all tap into, we can all share. And right now, at this time in particular, joy is so necessary.” That was the wisdom of experience talking, then he put it into action when he invited his studio team out with him to take a 20th anniversary bow.', 'Taylor Thompson took over the lush greenery at the New York Marble Cemetery at noon on the most beautiful day of New York Fashion Week. The sun was shining so bright that his models were holding umbrellas—a welcome contradiction to the literal undergroundness of his original inspiration.“It’s about this old punk bar in San Francisco called Mabuhay Gardens, which was a Filipino restaurant during the day and a bar at night,” said Thompson, walking around the lawn decked in head-to-toe black. “It was our version of CBGB at the time.” Thompson explained that ‘\"The Mab,” as it was known, was a place where artists like The Dead Kennedys or Black Flag could get their starts and find their voices. “The parallel felt fitting with everything going on,” he said.The goings on in question: Thompson and his 5000 label are finalists to the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund this year. The designer is based in San Francisco, but is showing his collection at NYFW this season as Fund finalists often do in September. Thompson is also celebrating his tenth year working in fashion since starting his career with Hood by Air during what feels like a long-gone era. “It’s a little emotional,” he said of staging his debut presentation and being back in New York, “maybe a little nostalgic, but otherwise it’s been… good.”His collection, said Thompson, featured a myriad of underworld inspirations, starting with the make-up, which enhanced the punkish club kid vibe of his collection. “I feel like basically all I do is structured tailoring,” he said with a laugh, “but having a lot of fun.”Fun were a pair of silver foil shorts with flared leg panels, or the way Thompson styled a thinner than paper thin athletic zip-up under a suit and placed a pleated skirt over shorts and then pinned it up. There’s a grittiness to the way Thompson Frankensteins more particular and out of the box fabrics—iridescent organzas, crinkly taffetas, camo jacquards—with his exact tailoring, particularly his jackets which are cut in that slim-fit yet slightly boxy 2000s style. Thompson has a solid opportunity of making this cut, and his many ingenious interpretations, a 5000 signature.Asked about whether he’d start showing in New York consistently, Thompson quipped: “The city is like a toxic ex-girlfriend, it always draws you back,” before adding more reflectively, “it’s been good to come here and have everyone look at the clothes and also seeing it all together, but I like being based in San Francisco; it’s important to think of American fashion like not just New York.” That much is true, but Thompson should keep his options open—nothing bad about visiting an old paramour every now and then.', 'Stella Ishii uses a paper calendar to keep track of the date. Each morning she rips off the day’s page, puts it aside, and goes about her day. Nothing particularly extraordinary, except that she keeps every single page, and has done for years.This same diaristic approach is one that her and her 6397 co-conspirators, which include head designer Lizzie Owens and, starting this season, career merchant and longtime Barney’s doyenne Judy Collinson, have made their signature. “We’ve been, for a few seasons now, expanding the community of 6397,” said Owens, “this has meant we’ve been asking bigger questions about ourselves, and Judy herself had a lot of questions, which has been clarifying and helped us distill it back to what it’s been.” What Owens meant by that is that this 6397 is the evolved, best, and truest version of the label. Said Ishii: “we all feel really good about this one.”And there was indeed lots to feel good about. The inarguable winners were a gray jersey skirt—the 6397 equivalent of a comfy pair of gray sweatpants—and a pair of shorts and matching shirt in the lightest and most deliciously diaphanous of silks. A duo of trench coats in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it iridescent suitings, which opened to delightful lining surprises, were new 6397 must-haves, ditto a pair of jeans made in a denim so thin it felt like tropical wool suiting, and a kimono made in austere but embracing fabrics.This is a label that has found a new energy over the last couple of seasons. Chalk that up to the arrival of Owens as a designer or, as she put it: “how many inter-generational women are round table-ing the design decisions we make as a brand.” These were clothes to live in, to rip the pages off your calendar and spend your every day in.']\n"
